Sticky labels often fall off so the professional way of marking specimens is to paint a white spot on which to write in ink. Paint is slow to dry and greasy to write on. Typist's correcting fluid (Liquid Paper, Tipp-Ex, etc) is supplied in small bottles with a brush in the cap. It dries within a minute or so and can be written on with ink, pencil or ball pen.
