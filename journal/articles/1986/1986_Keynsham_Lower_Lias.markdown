In June 1984 work commenced on the construction of a new Civic Amenity site in Keynsham. The site chosen was a field adjoining the former Great Western Railway at Pixash Lane. (O.S.676183)

Excavations for drains and foundations exposed beds belonging to the *turneri* zone of the Lower Lias Clays. These beds, situated above the Blue Lias, are only rarely exposed in this district so a detailed record of this section was made.

Tutcher (1923, pp. 270-271) recorded both *turneri* and *obtusum* zones at Saltford Mead which lies only a few miles east of this site. He was unable to record an accurate succession in the Lower Lias Clays as construction work had already been partially completed when the site was visited by him, much of the information regarding the position of the beds was provided by a Clerk of Works.

The *turneri* zone is characterised in this area by a predominance of clay. Bands of limestone and septarian nodules do, however, occur at certain horizons.

At the base of this exposure a line of septarian nodules were recorded and an example of the subzonal ammonite, *Microderoceras birchi* (J. Sowerby) extracted from them, along with an associated ammonite fauna which included *Promicroceras* sp., and *Cymbites* sp. Above these nodules was 1 foot (0.30m) of dark clay capped by several feet of river gravels and alluvium.

At Saltford Mead Tutcher (1923, pp. 270-271) also recorded septarian nodules with *Asteroceras*, indicative of the *obtusum* zone, in situ. At the Pixash Lane site these nodules, as well as some of the underlying beds of the *turneri* zone have been removed by erosion. The occasional fragment of an *Asteroceras*, or weathered nodule with *Promicroceras* and *Caenisites* in the river gravels prove their former existence here.

From the examination of the excavated material from the Pixash lane site, it was evident that beds below the septarian nodule bed were exposed previous to my visit but were now obscured. Nodules of a different lithic character were observed, light in colour, heavily pyritised and more lenticular in shape, as well as thin, impersistent beds of highly pyritised limestone. No ammonites were found in these lower beds.

Mr. T.R. Fry, recorded derived material from the *turneri* and *obtusum* zones in the river gravels which were formally extracted from the gravel pits on land at Stidham Farm, a short distance from the Pixash lane site. The material is represented by examples of the ammonites *Caenisites* and *Asteroceras*.

A specimen of *Caenisites turneri* (J. de C. Sowerby) was also found by Mr. T.R. Fry during temporary excavations at Chandag Road, Keynsham. More recently Mr. A. Bentley (1962) recorded several temporary sections in the lower Lias Clays, in connection with building works in the vicinity of the former Mothers Pride Bakery site, at Keynsham. The sections recorded show conclusively that the beds exposed here belong to the *obtusum* zone and represent the highest beds of the Lower Lias to be preserved in the Keynsham area.

A characteristic clay succession was recorded in which bands of limestone nodules and septaria were developed. The following ammonites were recorded by Mr. A. Bentley: *Asteroceras obtusum* (J. Sowerby), *Promicroceras planicosta* (J. Sowerby), *Promicroceras capricornoides* (Spath), *Xipheroceras cf. rasinodum* (Quenstedt), *Cymbites laevigatus* (J. de C. Sowerby) and *Eopophioceras landrioti* (d'Orbigny).

During construction of the Keynsham Bypass, Mr. A. Bentley (1964) recorded two nodule beds at surface exposures east of the Unity Road Underpass. *Caenisites* was collected from one nodule bed, while the other, which was in close proximity to Exposure 1 (Fig 1) yielded an *Asteroceras*.

I would like to thank Professor. D.T. Donovan for his identification of the ammonites and Mrs. S. Tutty for providing the excellent photograph of the specimens included here.
