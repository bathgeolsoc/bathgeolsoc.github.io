This talk summarises the geological history of Norway which has a broad range of beautiful rocks that are superbly exposed along its fjord coastline. All three major types of rock are present including igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and the talk will show specific examples from the locations that we will visit which helps to explain the scenery that we observe. The talk will also look at Norway’s rich economic resources including oil and gas, minerals and water.

<strong>Speaker:</strong> Andy spent most of his career as geoscientist in the energy sector. He currently gives talks to geological societies and is a guest lecturer on cruise ships. He is passionate about the earth sciences and loves to talk about how geology impacts the landscape. In his talks he feels it is vital to entertain as well as educate by making the subject matter fascinating and relevant to everyone whether expert or amateur. Whenever he travels, Andy researches the local geology to better understand the landscape and be able to share these ideas with fellow travellers. Over the last 3 years he has visited Norway 3 times which is a fabulous place to see rocks.
