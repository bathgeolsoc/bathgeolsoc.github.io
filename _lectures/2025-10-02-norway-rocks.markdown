This talk summarises the geological history of Norway which has a broad range of beautiful rocks that are superbly exposed along its fjord coastline. All three major types of rock are present including igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and the talk will show specific examples from the locations that we will visit which helps to explain the scenery that we observe. The talk will also look at Norway’s rich economic resources including oil and gas, minerals and water.
