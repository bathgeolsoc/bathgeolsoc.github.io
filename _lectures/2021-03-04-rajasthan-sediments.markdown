<strong>Abstract:</strong> The preserved deposits of continental sedimentary environments are inherently three-dimensional and highly varied: properties that make subsurface interpretations of such environments difficult to interpret from core alone. To provide an understanding of subsurface continental successions, extensive field studies are required to appreciate the geometry and scale of the system in three-dimensions, and to develop quantified models to use as guides in core interpretation. This work presents the development of quantified sedimentary models from outcrop of the Lower Cretaceous Ghaggar-Hakra Formation, Barmer Basin, India, as an example of the deposits of a spatially and temporally varied fluvial system, as a means to aid interpretation of subsurface core and interpret fault movements.
