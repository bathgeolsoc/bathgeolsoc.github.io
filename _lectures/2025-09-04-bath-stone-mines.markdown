The Museum of Bath Stone tells the story of the stone of Combe Down, its geology, archaeology, social history, ecology and engineering. Bath owes much of its character and architectural harmony to the stone from which it is built, Bath Stone. This material has been exploited since Roman times but came to its peak in the 18th century. The Museum of Bath Stone was created in 2014 to complete the legacy of the Combe Down Stone Mines Stabilisation Project. The quarrying had left the area at risk. The disused stone mines under Combe Down were stabilised and filled with foamed concrete, poured into the mines over 10 years. The museum exhibits record the history of the mines and the project to make them safe.
