Continental flood basalts are widely regarded as the surface manifestation of mantle plumes, and in some cases they are also associated with economic deposits of metal sulphides. However, there is increasing evidence that different flood basalts may have been generated under different conditions, and that some are linked to extension. The geology of the flood basalts in southern Africa, Brazil and West Greenland will be visited to assess the role of mantle plumes in the break-up of super continents like Gondwana, and the origins of associated sulphide depoists.
