This talk is about Dr Elder's work on the structural analysis of the Sumatra Fault Zone in Indonesia and studies of the sedimentary basins in the Sumatra back-arc, the Gulf of Thailand and onshore Thailand to evaluate the relative contributions of strike slip deformation and extensional tectonics in basin evolution on the continental margin and on the periphery of the India-Eurasia collision zone with some thoughts on the implications of the SE Asian Tsunami.
