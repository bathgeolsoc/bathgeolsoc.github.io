Earth is an ocean planet and yet only in the last century has systematic study of the deep ocean begun to unravel its mysteries. Already we have unveiled momentous discoveries that have led, directly or indirectly, to several of the great seminal ideas that shape our collective view of the world: the origin and evolution of life, the constant motion of the earth beneath our feet, the cyclic patterns of change, and ecological unity of the earth-ocean system.

Illustrated with a series of case studies from the author's own research - Himalayan peak to deep-sea fan, Cyprus and the Lost Tethys Ocean, Oil and gas from the abyss - this lecture seeks to explore both the scientific challenge and discovery, as well as the environmental and resource issues that face us today. As we enter the third millennium, we face the most important challenge ever - that of careful stewardship and sound management of the planet, not only for ourselves and our children but for the whole rich diversity of life whose world we have the privilege to cohabit.
