Wiltshire's landscape is inextricably bound up with the underlying rocks. The overall southeasterly dip exposes Jurassic limestones in the tail-end of the Cotswolds, the clays of the Avon vale, then more limestones and clays before the overlying Cretaceous rocks appear: first the Greensands and Gault Clay, then the Chalk of the downs. The latter has a patchy cover of Tertiary sands, gravel and clay. This variety, plus surprising curiosities such as the Wootton Bassett mud springs, the ironstones of Seend and Westbury, Jurassic marine reptiles, Ice Age mammals and the sarsen stones, provide much geological interest.

Lecture to be followed by a field trip on April 13th
