True gemstones occur naturally as products of geological processes. As such they are infinitely varied in form and colour. Their value depends on their rarity and also, however, on subjective notions of such matters as colour and transparency. The lecture will cover the recognition and identification of gemstones, and their colour-grading.

In recent years improved chemical techniques have made possible the artificial synthesis of many gemstones. There are also a number of more dubious techniques sometimes deliberately intended to deceive the unwary. The lecture will deal with the recognition and identification of gemstone substitutes, technically known as simulants.
