During the 21st century there have been major advances in the use of space technologies for the mapping of hazardous terrain and for disaster management. Natural hazards often have a devastating impact on poor countries - as illustrated by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and the 2013 Philippines typhoon/storm surge. This talk will examine how developments in satellite-based remote sensing are helping to reduce the impacts of natural hazards on communities, with case studies at the preparedness, crisis response and recovery stages of disaster management.
