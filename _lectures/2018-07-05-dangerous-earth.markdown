Natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, droughts, wildfires, landslides, storms and tsunamis have happened throughout geological time. The difference now is that as the population of the world increases some people are living in areas that maybe are not particularly sensible from a hazard perspective, but they have little choice. For others, the complexity of modern society means that a major event such as Hurricane Harvey can inflict catastrophic economic and social consequences on even the most sophisticated cities in the western world. This talk will examine the causes of consequences of a variety of hazards and show how, looking ahead, the impact of some  such events is likely to increase as climate, population and land use combine to amplify what are in reality entirely natural phenomena.
