The first part of the talk will deal with describing past changes of the Briksdalsbreen outlet glacier from the Jostedalsbreen ice cap, the largest ice cap on mainland Europe. The second part of the talk will be spent on presenting evidence of the size variations of the entire Jostedalsbreen ice cap during the last ~11,000 years, after the termination of the last ice age. Finally, an estimate of what may happen with Norwegian glaciers in a future climate will be presented.
