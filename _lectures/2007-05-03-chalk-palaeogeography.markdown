High sea-levels in the Late Cretaceous resulted in most of Britain being under the sea, but subsequent erosion has removed much of the evidence of its original extent. New techniques allow reconstruction of depositional histories over areas now stripped of Mesozoic cover and provide fresh evidence of the former extent of the Chalk and the dramatic way that it was removed from western Britain.
