The geology of an area previously not mapped due to the extensive spread of river gravels that obscure much of the solid geology in the Upper Thames Valley. The talk will highlight some of the significant palaeontological discoveries that have been made in the richly fossiliferous Kellaways and Oxford Clay formations. The overlying Quaternary River gravels have also yielded an abundant mammal fauna including rare lower Palaeolithic hand axes which were previously unrecorded from the local area.
