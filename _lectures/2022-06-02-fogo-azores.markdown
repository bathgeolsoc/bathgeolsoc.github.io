The first investigator of Cape Verde volcanism was Charles Darwin during the Voyage of the Beagle.  Although he made no landfall on Fogo he undoubtedly saw it from Santiago Island.  Fogo is a large complex volcano which has suffered a major flank collapse and the scar of this is the major influence on the island geomorphology.  The collapse event, c. 70 ka BP generated a major tsunami which impacted on the west coast of Santiago Island.  Within the collapse ‘caldera’ the current volcano has grown.  The latest phase of growth was during the period November 2014 – February 2015.  The course of this eruption will be described in detail.
