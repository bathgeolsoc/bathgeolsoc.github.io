Charles Darwin recognised some animal and plants as ‘living fossils’.  Professor Fortey has been on a journey around the world to study these organisms in their natural habitats. Why did some organisms pass through episodes of mass extinction that affected much of the biological world? Was it a matter of chance, or are there common factors in what he terms “Survivors”? He examines some of these questions through the stories of organisms ranging in size from a single cell to a tree. There may be some features that help some species to survive - mostly it is a matter of persistence of the appropriate habitats.
