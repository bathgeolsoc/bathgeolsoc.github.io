A hyper arid continental-wide desert. Yet the rocks and the physiographic features in the landscape all testify to development by water and by volcanic and tectonic, more likely, geodynamic, forces. This Reading of the Sahara has only just started. It is a personal research project using big data technology of remote sensing on the scale of North Africa. It has already thrown up some interesting questions for the research, that may rewrite interpretations of the landscape already written as well as write new interpretations.

This is a Zoom only lecture.
