Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to take to the skies, and the largest animals ever to achieve powered flight. The largest had wingspans rivalling small airplanes at 10-11m. The biggest birds today are nowhere near this size, with albatross wingspans of 3-4 m., and extinct birds may have reached up to 8 m. in size. Why were pterosaurs able to reach this great size? How were they able to fly? Exactly how heavy were these animals? With unique adaptations, pterosaurs were able to dominate the sky for over 150 million years.
