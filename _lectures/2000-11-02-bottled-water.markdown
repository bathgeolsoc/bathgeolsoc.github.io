Most bottled water is marketed in the UK as either "Natural Mineral Water" or "Spring Water". To comply with EU legislation such waters must be from an underground source; in other words they are groundwaters.

The ultimate source of most groundwater is rain and snow melt. This rapidly dissolves CO2 as it infiltrates through the soil, forming a weak acid which is very effective in dissolving rock minerals. The final composition of groundwater arises through a complex interaction of factors. However, certain geochemical characteristics such as the Mg/Ca ratio will be determined by the host rock, other constituents such as Cl may be dominated by atmospheric inputs and others such as SO4, NO3 and K may be influenced more by man's activities. An understanding of these factors enables the hydrogeologist to unravel the geochemistry of a groundwater.

These processes will be illustrated by reference to common bottled waters which can be bought in any supermarket.
