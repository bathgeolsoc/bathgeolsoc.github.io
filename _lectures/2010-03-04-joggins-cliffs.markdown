The Joggins Fossil Cliffs is a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia. These remote and wild cliffs were first made famous by Charles Lyell and William Dawson, who found spectacular fossil forests and early reptile skeletons in the 1840s and 1850s. The talk will deal with the history of research at the site as well as the exciting new discoveries of more recent times - all of which shed of light on the life and times of the Carboniferous ‘Coal Age’.
