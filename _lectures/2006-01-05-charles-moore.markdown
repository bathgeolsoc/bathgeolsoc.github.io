Charles Moore (1815-1881) was a life-long collector of fossils and a researching Palaeontologist of some merit. Moore was partly responsible for the establishing the Rhaetic in Britain and pioneered bulk picking techniques now used by palaeontologists around the world. After moving to Bath, his collection was displayed in its entirety at the BRLSI and on his death was bought by the Institution, where it is still housed. This collection can be regarded as the best of its kind in SW England and an insight in to the life and work of this extraordinary man gives us a fresh appreciation of our great Geological heritage here in Bath.
