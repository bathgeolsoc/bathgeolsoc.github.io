Professor Crawford will summarise what is known of the geology of the Moon and what it reveals about the history and evolution of the Earth-Moon system. His talk will describe what has been learned from 40 years of analysis of samples collected by the Apollo missions as well as more recent lunar missions, and make the scientific case for the future exploration of Earthâ€™s natural satellite.
