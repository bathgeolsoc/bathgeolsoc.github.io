The rock formations in the northern part of Ireland are very distinctive in colour and form and so the relationships between bodies of rock are beautifully displayed. There is much to see from the strange geometrical columns of the Giant's Causeway (now a World Heritage Site) to the layered lava flows. Elsewhere in the Antrim sea cliffs the white Cretaceous Chalk layer contrasts strongly with the red of the Trias Sandstone below and the black and brown of the Tertiary basalt above. In Donegal there is the complexity of the exposed roots of the Caledonian Mountains and wonderful wild landscapes. In the rugged glaciated hills, the hard Donegal Granite and the Crana Quartzite stand proud of the surrounding Dalradian schists. This is undoubtedly one of the best places in the world to study geology.

It is hoped that Dr. Arthurs will lead a field trip to the North irish Coast in 2006.
