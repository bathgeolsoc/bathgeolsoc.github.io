Iceland is a geologically young country with nothing older than 13 million years. It is also the only significant land mass that sits astride a mid-ocean ridge. This talk, that comes with a video presentation, examines something of the geology of the country and shows the 'battle' between the sea, ice and volcanoes in the shaping of the landscape.
