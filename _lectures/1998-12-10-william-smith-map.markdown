Liverpool Geological Society has owned an original 1815 William Smith geological map of England and Wales since 1900. Because of the great value of the map, Society members have never been able to enjoy or make use of the map until the LGS William Smith Map Project was launched. The story of William Smith, his map and our project will form the basis of this talk.
