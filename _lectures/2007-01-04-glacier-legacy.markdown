Glaciers exist where snow remains unmelted through the summer, forming ice. The ice in the glacier moves towards the margins forming distinctive landscape features, including broad deep valleys and striated rock surfaces. Changes in the ice margin reflect changes in climate. Past glacial positions help to reconstruct climate changes since the end of the last ice age. Understanding the pattern of past climate changes helps us to appreciate the context of changes likely to occur in the future.
