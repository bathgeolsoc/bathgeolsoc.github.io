The relatively moderate eruption of Eyjafjallajokull from March to May 2010 produced widespread dispersion of fine volcanic ash over Northern Europe resulting in airspace closure for six days and significant economic losses. This eruption changed our perception of the importance of small to moderate explosive eruptions and their hazard footprint. In this talk, Dr. Phillips will describe the eruption and new observations that have stimulated a significant research effort in the last three years to better characterise the hazard of airborne ash. He will present results from a number of international research projects focussing on improved volcano monitoring and near-real-time estimation of volcanic eruption parameters.
