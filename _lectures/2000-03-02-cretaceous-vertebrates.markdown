The Tetori Group, a sequence of predominantly slightly metamorphosed, fine grained sedimentary rocks, is exposed in Gifu Prefecture, on the northern coast of Honshu. These sediments are Lower Cretaceous in age, and have yielded a diverse vertebrate fauna. Taxa represented include fish, turtles and dinosaurs.

During the summer of 1996 Dr. Cook spent three weeks in Japan looking at the material and studying the field locality. During her talk she will introduce the geological context of the vertebrate collection, describe the field locality and discuss the taphonomic characteristics of the material.
