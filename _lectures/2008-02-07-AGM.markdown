Please note that the AGM is for members only. AGM will start at 7.00 p.m. followed by the lecture at 7.30 p.m.  Visitors are welcome to attend the evening's lecture.

After the business of the AGM has concluded, the committee feels that it would be an ideal opportunity to introduce the speaker for the March Lecture, Dr James Jackson. We will be showing the first of the Royal Institution Christmas lectures, called ‘On the Edge of the World’, that he gave in 1995.
