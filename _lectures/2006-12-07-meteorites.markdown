There are approximately 34,000 known meteorites. The lecture will discuss the different types and what information these important samples provide. Some meteorites record the very earliest stages of Solar System formation, whereas others give insights into planet forming processes; indeed by studying meteorites we gain insights into the structure of our own Earth.

Every year, approximately 40,000 tons of material lands on the Earth, most of which is in the form of tiny dust grains. However, larger 'bits' regularly land and occasionally a meteorite that is very large impacts with the Earth - with devastating consequences. As part of a study into the flux of material to Earth Dr Smith took part in a fieldtrip to Australia and she will talk about this project and how it fits in with the meteorite 'big picture'.
