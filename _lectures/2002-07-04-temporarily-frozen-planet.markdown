The attention of the scientifically-minded public has recently been captured by the idea that the Earth repeatedly went into a deep freeze during the Neoproterozoic era, 600-700 million years ago and shortly before the evolution of diverse forms of animals. The evidence for this proposition is a fascinating blend of geological observation, lateral thinking about Earth system science, and various forms of computer models. It remains highly probable that the ice ages that occurred were more intense than anything that has happened subsequently, but the Snowball Earth theory itself has a fight on its hands, despite its elegance.
