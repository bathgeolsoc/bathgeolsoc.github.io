The Arctic is a region critical for its role in modulating global climate, and there has been much recent publicity regarding the changes occurring in high northern latitudes as a consequence of anthropogenically-induced global warming. After touching on some of the predictions made for future Arctic climate conditions, the presentation will focus on what has been learnt recently about the hitherto poorly understood Cenozoic climatic history of the Arctic. The talk will focus on three main events (the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, the Azolla Event and the Eocene-Oligocene greenhouse-icehouse transition), and will be based on research the speaker has conducted on core material from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea and outcrops in the Svalbard Archipelago.
