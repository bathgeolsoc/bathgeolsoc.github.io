Mainland SE Asia consists of a number of plates which accreted during the Mesozoic. Field work in Laos indicates that the main stage of the Indosinian orogeny, when Burma and western Thailand sutured with Indochina, was end-Jurassic and not Triassic as previously held. A consideration of biogeographic affinities of Ordovician trilobites suggests a surprising position for Vietnam at that time and also resolves lingering suspicions in 'The Deprat Affair.'
