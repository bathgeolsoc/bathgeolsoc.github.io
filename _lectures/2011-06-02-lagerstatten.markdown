The factors giving rise to exceptionally preserved fossil deposits (or lagerstätten) will be followed by a review of the wealth of sites yielding such deposits in Germany. This will include highlights of the better known deposits such as the Devonian Hunsrückerschiefer, the Jurassic Posidonienschiefer and Solnhofen Plattenkalk and the Eocene Lake Messel deposit, all of which provide palaeontologists with a ‘window in time’ which have allowed the reconstruction of individual organisms and whole ecosystems in unpecedented detail. Less well known is the Oligocene Sieblos deposit, from where an exceptionally preserved asemblage of unicellular planktonic dinoflagellate fossils are being described.
