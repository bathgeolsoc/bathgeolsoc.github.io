Folded layers in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks display a wide variety of forms. Such structures are not only aesthetically pleasing but are also important for the location and extent of natural resources such as hydrocarbons and mineral deposits. This talk will illustrate some of the factors controlling the shapes of folds. Simple paper folding models illustrate the control exerted by strong (competent) layers within a sequence and form the basis of a method of predicting fold geometry in the subsurface. These rules are useful for predicting fractured zones within hydrocarbon reservoirs and for our understanding of the shapes of complex fold structures resulting from two phases of folding.
