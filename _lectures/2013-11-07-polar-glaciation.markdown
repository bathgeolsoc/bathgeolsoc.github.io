James Cresswell has spent the last six years working as an expedition guide in the Polar Regions. This visual presentation, full of photos and video clips, gives an overview of the different forms and changing nature of 'ice' in these regions. The presentation discusses the great ice sheets, the floating ice shelves, as well as icebergs and sea ice. With the recent collapse of several Antarctic Ice Shelves, negative mass balance recorded for both the West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets, and 2012 being the year with the minimum ever recorded extent of Arctic Sea Ice; it is clear that polar ice is currently undergoing dramatic change.
