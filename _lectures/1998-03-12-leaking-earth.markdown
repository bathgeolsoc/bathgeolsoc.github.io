This talk will deal with mineral deposits associated with fluids which leak out of the Earth. Dr. Fleet will concentrate on submarine deposits, including hot solutions which leak on to the sea floor around oceanic ridges, and cold fluids (water, oil and gas) which leak around continental margins. He will also mention the biota which are concerned with these deposits.
