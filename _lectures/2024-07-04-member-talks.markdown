Several of our members will give short (10-15 minute) talks covering a variety of different geological topics:

Jonathan Slack: “Fun With Thin Sections”: Jonathan will share some of the wonders of optical petrology as revealed by his collection of home-made thin-sections.

Eric Squires: “The Dry Chalk Valleys of Cranborne Chase”: Eric’s illustrated talk will describe the characteristic features, probable origins and some of the unusual features of the dry chalk valleys on the edge of Cranborne Chase where he lives.

Mellissa Freeman will describe her trip to Greenland with the Geological Society of Glasgow in 2023 – lots of pictures and impressive geology.

Kerry Hickman will show some of the photos and videos taken on their recent trip to the Aeolian Islands visiting Stromboli and Vulcano.
