Volcanism is usually perceived as a destructive force, and yet one that has shaped our planet for billions of years. However, with technology, expeditions, and minds reaching into further afield environments, we're beginning to gain a greater appreciation for just how well connected volcanism is to ecosystems across our planet and beyond. Increasing amounts of interdisciplinary research are pushing frontiers in the areas of volcanism and ecosystems, from the most primitive bacterial stage to the development of entire macroecological colonies. In this talk we'll take a dive into some of the most extreme environments across Earth and our solar system, and look at how volcanism is aiding the development and harbouring of life.
