The hot waters of bath have been a leisure centre since the romans constructed their baths complex not long after their arrival in 43 ce, with the supposed benefits to health reaching new heights in georgian times in the 1700s to early 1800s. however, there are several aspects of the hot springs and roman baths that are of particular interest to earth scientists, apart from the fact that this is the only true thermal spring (since water temperature is > 37oc) in the uk. spectacular biofilms have developed in the baths and associated with them are mineral precipitates and travertines exhibiting a range of textural character and colour. this talk will present an overview of the processes involved in the deposition of the travertines incorporating the results of recent studies carried out by undergraduates at bristol university. we will provide an update on the concepts involved, in particular the roles of bacteria and viruses in carbonate precipitation and an overview of the geochemical properties of the bath waters.

<i><strong>About the Speakers:</strong><br>
<strong>Lucy Stott</strong> is a final year Environmental Geoscience undergraduate at Bristol University and has recently participated in a study examining the precipitation of travertine in the Roman Baths of Bath.</i>

<i><strong>Professor Maurice Tucker</strong> needs no introduction to members of the Bath Geological Society and has previously commented on the nature of biofilms and minerals in the Roman Baths in the 2022 Bath Geological Society Journal.</i>

<strong>Please note:</strong> this will be a hybrid lecture – it will take place in person at BRLSI, Queen Square Bath, BA1 2HN, but will also be broadcast via Zoom for those unable to join us in person.
