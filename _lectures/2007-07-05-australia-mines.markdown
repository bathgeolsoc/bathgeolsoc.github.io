Australia is currently one of the main sources of the world's mineral wealth. First in the production of diamonds, bauxite and zirconium; second in lead, zinc, titanium, uranium: third in gold, nickel, iron ore and coal and fourth in copper, silver and manganese - all this is from a country slightly smaller than the USA with a population of only 21 million. The talk will give a brief history of the development of the Australian mining industry and describe some of the more recent discoveries.
