Wadi Faynan provides a spectacular desert landscape in southern Jordan. Today it quite arid and inhabited by scattered Bedouin living traditional transhumance lifetsyles. And yet it contains a remarkable archaeological record, ranging from Palaeolithic handaxes to a small urban Roman settlement, one of the key copper mining centres in the Ancient world. This lecture will review this archaeology focussing on the early Neolithic site of WF16 - one of the few settlements in Jordan created right at the transition from hunting-gathering to farming lifestyles.
