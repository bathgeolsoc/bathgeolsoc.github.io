<div style="float: left; width: 64%;"><strong><p>The 50th Anniversary Lecture given by Professor Jon Blundy, Royal Society Research Professor, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford.</p></strong>

<strong><p>This lecture heralds the start of our long-awaited celebrations. Please join us at this prodigious event and enjoy celebratory drinks after wards.</p></strong>

<p>The transition to Net Zero will place unprecedented demand on natural resources requiring some new thinking about where to find them and how to extract them. In this talk I will explore the potential for magmatic systems, such as those beneath volcanoes, to provide accessible sources of both geothermal power and a diversity of metals including many that essential for the energy transition. I will draw upon new research in volcanology, igneous petrology, economic geology and high-pressure and temperature experiments.
