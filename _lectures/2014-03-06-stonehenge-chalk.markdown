Discovery of a unique and previously unkown geology during investigations for the A303 Stonehenge Tunnel, including phosphatic chalks, raised many issues about the origins of such deposits and implications for tunnel construction. The talk will show how the geology was investigated and the potential impact this geology had for the local environment as well as tunnel construction.
