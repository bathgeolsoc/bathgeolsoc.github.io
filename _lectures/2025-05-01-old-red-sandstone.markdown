This talk will give details on the types of palaeosols that were preserved in the Old Red Sandstone and how they can be used, together with information from trace fossils and sedimentology, to interpret changes in climate, fauna and flora and to show how stable the land surface was likely to have been during a time when widespread terrestrialisation was occurring.
