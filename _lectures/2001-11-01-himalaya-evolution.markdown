The collision of the Indian plate with Central Asia approximately 50 million years ago created all of the high topography and thick crust along the Himalaya and most of the high topography and thick crust along the Asian plate in the Karakoram and Tibet. The structural, metamorphic and magmatic results of this, the greatest continental collision in the last 300 million years, will be presented in this talk.
