Palaeontology has long been defined by its data, the fossil record. Together, molecular biology and the fossil record can be integrated to address fundamental palaeontological questions. This spans from the nature of ancient ancestors to the patterns, processes and timescales of evolutionary change at the grandest scale, extending the reach and power of the discipline beyond the limits of the fossil record.
