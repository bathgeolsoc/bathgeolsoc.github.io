The islands of Trinidad and Tobago lie at the junction between the South American and Caribbean plates. The area has generated hydrocarbon accumulations which provide much of the economic revenue for this island nation. Graham P Hickman, formerly with BP Exploration, describes the geology and adventure in the search for gas fields in the offshore Columbus basin, Trinidad.
