Eastern and midland England provide the earliest evidence for humans (hominins) in northern Europe. A recent body of evidence suggests that humans may have lived in Britain as early as around 1 million years ago, but certainly there is good evidence for humans in the British land area around 750,000 years ago. The lecture will outline the history of the research, the evidence for human occupance, the nature of the environment and climate in which they lived, and the reasons why Britain (so far north) has provided this evidence.
