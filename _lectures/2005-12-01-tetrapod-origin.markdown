Less than two decades ago, the transition between 'fish' with fins and 'tetrapods' with limbs and digits was represented only by two animals: the fish Eusthenopteron and the tetrapod Ichthyostega. Recent work has not only changed our ideas about the 'fish' side of the transition, but has provided a new view of early tetrapods. Exquisite new material from around the world has produced a far different view of how tetrapods and their limbs evolved, and has radically changed what we thought we knew about Ichthyostega.
