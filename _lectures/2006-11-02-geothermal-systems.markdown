Geothermal systems come in two basic kinds, high and low enthalpy, which means basically with or without the capacity to generate significant quantities of steam. The former tend to give rise to the more spectacular surface manifestations, and are often exploited for their touristic or electricity-generating potential, but the latter are much more widespread, being generally used for spa or district heating purposes. The talk will cover how both types of system work, how their potential is assessed prior to possibly expensive drilling, and the various ways in which they are exploited; some being perhaps less obvious than others. There will be a brief review of the latest information we have on the age and origin of the thermal waters of Bath.
