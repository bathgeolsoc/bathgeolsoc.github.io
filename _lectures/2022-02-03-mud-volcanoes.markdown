Mud volcanoes occur at the earth’s surface in many parts of the world, but especially in areas where sediments are deposited rapidly, such as modern deltas. The talk will explain the common features of mud volcanoes (found in the rock record and at the present day) and how they can inform us about deep, high-pressure reservoirs and associated supplies of mud capable of fracturing rocks, with fracture propagation rates of more than 1.0 km a day! What would trigger such an event? Sometimes human intervention accidentally creates suitable conditions for such explosive action, illustrated by review of the LUSI mud volcano, Java, Indonesia which erupted in a paddy field in 2006 and continues to flow today.
