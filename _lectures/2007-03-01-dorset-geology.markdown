The Dorset coast is world-famous for its fossils. Its reputation started with Mary Anning who collected ichthyosaurs and other large marine reptiles from Lyme Regis. Other fossils such as ammonites and brittle starfishes are collected but microfossils are almost totally ignored. The talk concentrates on a summary of the late Triassic to Early Cretaceous coastal rocks, what microfossils occur and how they can be extracted.
