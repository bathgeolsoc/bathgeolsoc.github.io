Luminescence dating is amongst the most versatile of geological chronometers. Drawing on ubiquitous, resilient datable material it can estimate the age of sedimentary events and heated archaeological artefacts spanning c. 10 to >105 yrs. This talk will outline the principles of this technique and instances where it has played a central role in uncovering past climate change and the evolution and dispersal of Hominins.
