The rocks of Pembrokeshire probably display more variety than in any other area of equivalent size in the UK and have special historic significance in the development of geological science. The solid rocks range in age from Precambrian to Upper Carboniferous and have been greatly affected by the Caledonian and Variscan orogenies. The development of the scenery is related to events which occurred from the Cretaceous period to the present.

This illustrated lecture will provide a summary, and will be of special interest to anyone planning a visit to the area (the Society intends to organise a field excursion to Pembrokeshire in 2000).
