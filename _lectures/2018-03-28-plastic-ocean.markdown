<span style="color: red;">Unfortunately this year's March lecture has been cancelled. The lecturer was intending to travel to Bath from Germany but due to extreme weather forecast for the next two days we have decided not to proceed.</span>

‘A Plastic Ocean’ is an award-winning documentary film, which uncovers the shocking truth about what is truly lurking beneath the ocean’s surface. More than 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into the world’s oceans each year with catastrophic consequences. Sir David Attenborough has described it as “the most important film of our time”.

This screening (90 minutes) is followed by a short Q&A session.
