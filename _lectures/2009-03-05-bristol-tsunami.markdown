The Killer Wave of 1607 which caused the flood in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary was the worst ever recorded in the British Isles. The area affected stretched from North Devon, through Somerset and Gloucestershire, and along the South Wales coast from Monmouthshire to Carmarthenshire, some 570 km of coast! The coastal population was devastated with at least 2000 fatalities, according to one of the contemporary sources. In some parts of the coast the population never recovered from the social and economic disaster. Professor Haslett has used documentary and fieldwork evidence to propose a new interpretation of its cause as a tsunami.
