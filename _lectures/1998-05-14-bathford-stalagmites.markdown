The geochemical and geophysical properties of the waters dripping on to stalagmites in the mines have been monitored every 10 days for 2 years. The aim is to compare changes in drip rate with rainfall over the last 2 years, to see how stalagmites respond to rainfall variations. How this is recorded in changes in geochemistry and geophysics can then be seen. By using these variables, climate, particularly rainfall, of the last 150 years will be studied to see the changes through time.
