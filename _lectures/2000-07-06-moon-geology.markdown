In May 1961 Alan Sheperd became the first American in space with a flight that lasted 15 minutes. This achievement inspired J.F. Kennedy to say that the USA should aim to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. The dream was realised when Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin set foot on the moon on 20th July 1969 in the spacecraft Apollo 11. Six further missions set off for the moon, with Apollo 13 being the only unsuccessful spacecraft. The last three missions, (Apollo 15, 16 and 17) with the introduction of a lunar roving vehicle gave us most of our scientific information. Apollo 17 had on board the only trained geologist to go to the moon and much was leaned from that mission. The Apollo project finished in December 1972. Sadly humans have not been to the moon since. The idea of lunar colonisation in the foreseeable future appears to have taken a back seat to Mars missions.
