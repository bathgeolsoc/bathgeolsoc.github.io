This talk will examine how conducting geophysical surveys, both Resistivity and Magnetometry, to professional standards can assist local community groups in archaeological endeavours.

Tony Roberts is an Associate of the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists who runs a company called Archeoscan which provides opportunities for public involvement in archaeological excavations and surveys based mainly in the counties of Gloucestershire, South Gloucestershire, Bristol, BANES, Wiltshire and Somerset. As such Tony has close links with the Bath and Counties Archaeological Society.
