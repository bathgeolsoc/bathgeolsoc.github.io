Douglas Adams’s holistic detective Dirk Gently explored the ‘fundamental interconnectedness of things’. This is a great description of modern Earth Sciences, which attempts to understand interactions between complex systems. In this talk Dr Trueman will illustrate some of these connections in a personal way, by describing his scientific journey from geology through palaeontology, archaeology, marine ecology and medical research - all through the eyes of an Earth Scientist. Eventually he hopes to convince his audience that geology and Earth Science is about a lot more than rocks, and in fact is an ideal preparation for understanding the main scientific dilemmas of our age.
