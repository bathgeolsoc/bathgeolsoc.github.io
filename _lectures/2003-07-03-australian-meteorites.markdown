2003 will see the publication of the 2nd Edition of the Catalogue of Western Australian Meteorites (Dr. McCall prepared issue 1 in the 1960s and two supplements). It would be suitable to concentrate on the remarkable growth in importance of this State (it is 1/3 the size of the contiguous United States) in Meteoritics. In his talk he will highlight and illustrate the important aspects of meteoritics that have been involved in this process.

He will mention: the early curators especially E.S. Simpson, his period there and his associates J.R. de Laeter and W.H. Cleverly, Alex Bevan's present work there and the amazing collections of John Carlile, a rabbit trapper.

The talk will then cover 9 impact crater/structures, (including the Wolfe Creek Crater which the speaker mapped); the collection of some 200 separate meteorites from the Nullarbor Limestone Desert (some with 600 or 800 or more fragments) (up to 11 tonnes individual weight), numerous rare and even unique finds including one lunar-spalled off meteorite; also the enigmatic tektites found widely on the surface of the State.
