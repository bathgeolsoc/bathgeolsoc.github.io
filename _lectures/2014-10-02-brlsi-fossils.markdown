Charles Moore (1815-1881) was a prodigious collector of fossils, who during his very active life established the presence of the “Rhaetic” in Britain, promoted the understanding of geology in Bath by making his collection freely available for the public benefit, discovered an internationally important early Jurassic Konservat-Lagerstätten, and provided a resource for palaeontological research that is yielding fantastic new knowledge to this day. Moore’s life, work, and legacy will be explored in this talk. Matt is almost certainly the world expert on Charles Moore.
