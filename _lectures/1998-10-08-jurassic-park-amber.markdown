This talk will be about the formation of amber, its occurrence geographically and through geological time, with specific reference to the Baltic and Dominican Republic. This will lead on to an illustration of the biological inclusions within amber from around the world, soft tissue preservation and preserved biomolecules (fossil DNA), and the consequences of finding fossil DNA in these specimens (set against the context of the film Jurassic Park) - if indeed fossil DNA has actually been extracted from any of the specimens at all!
