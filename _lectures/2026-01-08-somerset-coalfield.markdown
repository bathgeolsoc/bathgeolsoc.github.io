This lively and informative talk will present Andy’s observations and interpretation of the geology and history of the Somerset coalfield. The content will include an overview of the geological setting and an introduction to the geological pioneers responsible for the development of the coalfields. This will lead on to a discussion of coal measure fossils and the complex faulted structure inherited from the Variscan orogeny. 

*About the speaker:* Andy gained a geology degree at Edinburgh University in 1982. After 5 years working on oil drilling rigs, mostly in the Norwegian Arctic Circle, he made a career change to IT Networks and Communications. In 2021 he moved to Yeovil. On retiring in 2022, Andy joined the Somerset Geology Group (SGG) and the Dorset Building Stones Group where he has rediscovered his love of geology. Andy serves as the webmaster for the SGG and is part of the coordinating team for this volunteer group focused on appreciating, conserving, and promoting Somerset's geology. He leads guided geological walks, such as those exploring the quarries and history of Ham Hill, linking geology to archaeology and local history, and is involved with research into traditional building stones.
