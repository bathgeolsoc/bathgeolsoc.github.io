Simon has been collecting fossil marine reptiles from the clay pit at Westbury, Wiltshire for several years. He has found many exciting fossils including a turtle, pliosaurs, plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs - all preserved in the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay at Westbury. More recently, he has found a new species of crocodile. All these fossils belong to the Jurassic Period and are approximately 140 million years old. Simon will talk about his latest finds, how they were discovered, prepared and conserved. Simon will be bringing a selection of his finds with him for people to see and hold.
