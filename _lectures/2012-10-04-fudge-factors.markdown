“A close analogy exists in the making of fudge, wherein if the candy is poured or otherwise agitated after crystallization has advanced beyond a certain stage there results a rough, spinose, somewhat granular surface akin to the surface of 'a'a” Macdonald (1953)

In many respects, fudge is a good analogue for basaltic lava, and making fudge leads to memorable lessons on both the fundamentals of crystal nucleation and growth and the importance of crystals in controlling the morphology of basaltic lava flows ('a'a vs. pahoehoe). The talk will discuss the role of crystals in basaltic lava flow rheology and morphology, compare basalt and fudge crystallization processes and textures, and assess the fudge-basalt analogy. An added bonus will be samples of 'a'a and pahoehoe fudge to taste!
