The arid coastal plain (sabkha) of Abu Dhabi is a sequence of shallow sub-tidal and supra- tidal carbonate sediments have accumulated, in a very arid environment, after a rise in sea level 7000 years BP. After deposition, reactions between the very saline groundwaters and the carbonate sediments has resulted in the dolomitisation of the fine carbonate mud and the growth of gypsum and anhydrite within the deposits. These deposits are very similar to the Permian (Khuff) deposits in Arabia. This talk will describe the modern environment and the deposits produced and then compare them to ancient deposits.
