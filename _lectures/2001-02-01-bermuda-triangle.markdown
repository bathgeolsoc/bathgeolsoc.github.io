Unexplained losses of ships and aircraft have been attributed to the catastrophic release of methane into the ocean bubbling up from destabilised gas hydrate on the ocean floor. Such events have been documented for over 250 years. Gas hydrate occurs under polar permafrost and on the floors of the world's oceans. In addition to its role in maritime catastrophes, gas hydrate is an important energy resource and a possible driver of rapid climatic change.
