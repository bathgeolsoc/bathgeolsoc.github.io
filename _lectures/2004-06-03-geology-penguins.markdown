Within its historical and geological context, this talk illustrates the landscape, geomorphology, geology and wildlife of the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia and the Theron Mountains, Antarctica, which were only discovered by the Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1956. The talk is based on the speaker's work as a geologist with the British Antarctic Survey including time in the Antarctic in 1965-1967.
