Unlock the magic of geology by exploring landscapes from the world of Harry Potter to understand more about the geology of the Highlands. Using insights gleaned from the filming locations we can speculate where the ‘unplottable’ castle of Hogwarts might be located and interpret the visible rock types seen in this series. From the building stones of the Ministry of Magic to the glacial processes shaping the route of the Hogwarts express we will uncover the geological underpinnings of these fantastical landscapes. Harnessing the cultural appeal of popular films like Harry Potter can be a useful tool for igniting interest in Earth Science so join ‘Professor McGonagall’ as we transfigure our way from the Dalradian to the Holocene - where science meets storytelling.
