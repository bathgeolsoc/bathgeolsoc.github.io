The Wye and Usk Foundation is trying to restore the fisheries of these rivers. The many adverse factors that have caused the decimation of the salmon run will be described. Of special interest is the current project on the Upper Wye to reverse the effects of acid rain. In a number of the extremities of the river system where a combination of high rainfall and a certain geology exist, there is currently no recorded fish life whatsoever and this has been the case for over 25 years. Is it possible to restore the estimated 62 km of 'acidified' waters, how and at what cost?
