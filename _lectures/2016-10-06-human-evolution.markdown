Human evolution has traditionally been seen as a linear succession of ancestors from the primitive Australopithecus species via Homo erectus to modern humans, Homo sapiens. This lecture reviews evidence that multiple species coexisted throughout our evolutionary past, demonstrating that the present, with just a sole human species, is an exception rather than the norm.
