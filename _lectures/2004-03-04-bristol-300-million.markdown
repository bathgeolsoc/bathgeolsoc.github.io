Bristol has moved northwards about 0.08 degree every million years. This lecture relates local building stones used in the city centre to the palaeogeography of the land now occupied by the city. Climate and landscape are inferred by reference to modern examples. The lecture concludes with a prediction for the near future (in geological time).
