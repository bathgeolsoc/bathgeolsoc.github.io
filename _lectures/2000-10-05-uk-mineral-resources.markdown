The UK is a major producer of oil and gas from our offshore resources, but there is also an important extractive industry involving construction raw materials and industrial minerals, worth over Â£2 billion annually. These provide many of the essential minerals for our basic industries. At present The UK has no metal ore production. The lecture will give a review of the UK extractive industry, illustrating the wide range of mineral produced and the interesting geology involved in understanding their origins and properties.
