Darwin still bestrides the evolutionary stage, but is it time to call for a scene change? Darwin got it very largely right, but is that all there is to say? Whispers of a post-Darwinian world are growing: a world where evolution has learnt to evolve and by no means is everything as random as is often thought.

This lecture is celebrating Darwin200, a national programme of events celebrating Charles Darwin’s 200th birthday on 12th February 2009. The BRLSI has organised its own programme, ‘Darwin and Beyond’ - further details on the BRLSI website.
