The talk will examine the current state of understanding of the geological processes operating in the oceans and their effects. Our knowledge and interpretation has changed quite radically since the 1950s, and continues to develop, enabling better understanding of the geology of ophiolites, such as the Lizard and Ballantrae; the environmental relationships between plate tectonic processes, the oceans and the mantle, and our interpretation of the geology of our near neighbour planets. Changes that are thought to have taken place in the oceans through geological time will be discussed as well as the anthropogenic effects of the present.
