How do you attempt to explain the geological history of the Earth and plate tectonics within the compass of a single book? Prof. Fortey will explain how he told the story of our planet by visiting a number of Geology's "holy places". He approaches geology first through what it does to our landscape and history, then tunnelling down to the deeper causes.
