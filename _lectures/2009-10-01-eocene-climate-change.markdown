The Eocene world was much warmer than modern, with tropical-type conditions extending into the polar regions. Then in the Oligocene the world cooled dramatically and a large ice cap appeared on Antarctica. In this lecture Paul Pearson assesses the latest evidence for this climate transition, the effect on life and sea level, and investigates possible explanations.
