As at Bath, the Regency buildings of Cheltenham required huge amounts of freestone from local quarries. Unlike Bath's 'mines', the underground quarries at Dodwell Hill have been lost for nearly 150 years. This talk will reveal the pivotal part the quarry played in building Cheltenham. The geology of the stone beds is traced, and the methods used by the quarrymen explained. A pamphlet explaining the geology will be on sale.
