After a cliff fall in 2000 on the beach at Black Ven near Charmouth, Dorset, professional collector David Sole made the discovery of a lifetime. He found the partial remains of a Scelidosaur that turned out to be the finest dinosaur specimen ever found in Britain. Dubbed the Horned Scelidosaur this spectacular, 3-metre (9 foot) specimen has a devilish grin, magnificent body armour and even the contents of its last meal preserved.

Dr Tim Ewin, currently curating a display on the Horned Scelidosaur, will introduce these spectacular British dinosaurs and the world they inhabited and describe the remains of the finest dinosaur ever discovered in Britain.

Scelidosaurs were heavily armoured, quadrapedal, herbivorous, dinosaurs the size of a small car that roamed the lush tropical world of the Lower Jurassic some 190 million years ago. This dinosaur specimen will be on public displayed from Spring 2008 in the Dinosaur Gallery at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.
