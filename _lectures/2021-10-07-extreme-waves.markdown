Surveys of coastlines in the Yucatan peninsular, Mexico and the Iberia coastline have demonstrated the presence of large coastal ridges consisting of very large boulders, the deposition of which is believed to be Extreme Wave Events (EWE). In the Yucatan Peninsular these ridges are up to 5m in height and consists of boulders some of which are >1m in size. In Iberia the ridges studied are up to 4m above sea level and again consist of blocks >1m in size. Two possible modes of deposition are considered, deposition as a result
of major storm activity or deposition as a part of a tsunami event and models applied to determine which of these is more likely at each location.
