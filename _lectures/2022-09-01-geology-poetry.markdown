I'll be talking about poetry and geology. How does a poet become involved with stones and rocks?
What can poetry and geology say to each other? What is the potential in collaborations between scientists and poets?

I'll be reading poetry, telling stories, asking questions. The talk will be an exploration and evocation of a life that has been shaped and influenced by words and stones and the relationships between them.
