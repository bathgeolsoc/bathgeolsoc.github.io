This talk we will be discussing the work we have been doing in trying to unravel the Palaeozoic, and in particular pre-Devonian, structural evolution of England and Wales. Our analysis is based on the integration of the available gravity, magnetics, and seismic data together with the borehole data as well as the available post drilling studies.
