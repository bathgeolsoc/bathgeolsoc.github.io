This talk gives an overview of this gentleman geologist, based in Victorian Bath.  He was a remarkably astute collector who cut his geological teeth on the Middle Lias beds around Ilminster.  Here he made important collections of ichthyosaur, crocodile, fish and insect fossils from the Strawberry Bank Conservation Lagerstätte. After marrying well, Moore moved from Ilminster to Bath where he became an important member of both the Bath Naturalists’ Field Club and the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society.  He collected widely, pioneered bulk processing of sediment in his search for fossils; his enormous private collection was obtained by the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution and has had a chequered history ever since. Moore is probably best known for finding some of the earliest mammals in the Late Triassic fissure deposits at Holwell near Frome.  He recognised the presence of the latest Triassic Rhaetian stage in Britain. Although not publishing much during his lifetime, his fossil collection still provides important material for research.
