Certainly, a current ‘hot topic’ for a number of reasons - this lecture will be broad reaching and highlight the role of the geosciences in planning, constructing and installing the infrastructure associated with the offshore and marine energy sector. Managing the risk associated with the seabed and ‘shallow’ geology is paramount to the safe, efficient and effective development of an offshore energy project. Peter will highlight the processes involved and the role each plays in characterising and understanding the geology and more specifically the geohazards associated with a given project – the sector is currently not without its challenges and polemics!

Peter has a background of 40 years’ experience in the geoscience and offshore energy industry having had a variety of technical and project management roles with contractors, consultancies and operator/developers. Peter has a wide knowledge of the geosciences in general and in particular marine geology and geotechnics, particularly regarding the technologies and their application in offshore survey, site investigation, offshore construction and subsea installation within the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors. Based in Bath, Peter is also a long-time member of the Bath Geological Society. This will be a live and virtual lecture at BRLSI, Queen Square, Bath
