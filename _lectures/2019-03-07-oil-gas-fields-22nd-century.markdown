Hydrocarbon exploration and production are experiencing crucial changes at the moment, as environmental aspects are becoming more important as the world's population continues to grow. The planet will host some 9 billion people at the end of the 21th century, with most of the population growth occurring in developing countries. Hence, the way oil and gas is used, at present, will change dramatically in this Century so that we can curtail CO2 emissions (and atmospheric pollution) while tackling energy poverty. This talk will present some interesting geological facts from the largest oil and gas fields in the world. It will show how these fields are being exploited in an ever more sustainable way. The examples provided will illustrate how governments, industry and the public are investing in new technologies and approaches to energy production.
