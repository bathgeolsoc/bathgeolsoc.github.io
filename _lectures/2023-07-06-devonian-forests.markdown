Over the past 30 years much information has come to light about the nature of the Earth’s first forest ecosystems. The new evidence has come from both exceptionally preserved fossils, allowing the first accurate reconstructions of early forest trees, and from ‘fossil forests’, which allow entire ecosystems to be visualised. Examples will be developed from Germany, New York and Svalbard to reveal a completely new understanding of the transition to a forested planet.
