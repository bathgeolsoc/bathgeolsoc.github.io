Petra, Jordan, is a remarkable site of antiquity with wonderful buildings and tombs sculpted directly into the Cambrian sandstone outcrops. But much of Petra’s beauty is the result of geological processes over half a billion years, providing a strategic location for the Nabataean people where they could establish their control on the lucrative trade route in luxury goods. This talk explores those geological processes: tectonic, sedimentological, diagenetic, structural, seismic and geomorphological.
