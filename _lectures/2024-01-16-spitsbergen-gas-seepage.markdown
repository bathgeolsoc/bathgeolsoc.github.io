This talk presents the first systematic observations of active gas seepage from the seafloor in the main fjords of western Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago. Two research cruises in August 2015 and June 2021 have identified over 800 gas seepage sites which have been characterized. The geological control on the distribution is presented from interpreting regional seismic data and studying the bedrock architecture controls. This study is an important step towards the assessment of how near-shore seepage impacts upon the carbon budget of Svalbard fjords, which constitute a globally recognized early climate change warning system for the High Arctic.

This is a Zoom only lecture.
