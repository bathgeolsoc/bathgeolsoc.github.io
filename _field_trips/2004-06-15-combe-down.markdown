We will go round the sites of the old quarries to see what there is to see (which is quite a bit) and talk about the quarrying operations. Also look at some of the local uses of the stone. We will consider briefly what is being done to stabilize the undergroung workings by infilling, and what might happen by way of conservation.

Meet at Holy Trinity Church (Combe Down parish church) in Church Road, at 6.45. There is no off-road parking at Combe Down, but no shortage of space on the roads usually, including Church Road itself. Bus service from Bath: Routes 2 & 4 (which are the same from the city centre to Combe Down). There is a no.2 at 6.18 from Dorchester Street (bus stop Bl) and a no.4 at 6.33. Journey time 10 minutes. You can get these buses at Grand Parade (stop Ci) a few minutes earlier. Get off in Combe Down village (which is not the terminus).
