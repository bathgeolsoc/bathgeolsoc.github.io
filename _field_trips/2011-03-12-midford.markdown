The walk will begin by looking at old stone workings in Combe Down village and the Combe Down stone in buildings (eg the church). Next we shall see the Great Oolite in old quarries in Summer Lane (anyone wishing to get up close to quarry walls should bring a hard hat). We then walk down the footpath to Tucking Mill across Fullerâ€™s Earth, Inferior Oolite* and Bridport (Midford) Sands* (*exposures). Next we follow the railway path to Midford (cuttings in Inferior Oolite*) and then the Cam Valley bottom for 500m (features of the Somerset Coal Canal). Finally we take the footpath up to Southstoke where we visit the Southstoke Millenium viewpoint (scenic and geological panorama).

Meet at Holy Trinity Church in Church Road, Combe Down at 10.30. We end at Southstoke between 3 and 4. The total walking distance is about 5km, with 120m descent and ascent.
