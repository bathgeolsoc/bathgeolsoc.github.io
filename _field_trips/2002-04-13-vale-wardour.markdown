This lovely part of south-west Wiltshire is an anticline with its crest eroded by the River Nadder to expose the Jurassic core. Thus we have upper valley sides rimmed with Chalk above Upper Greensand, with the latest Jurassic Purbeck and Portlandian limestones exposed in the heart of the vale, below the Cretaceous unconformity. There will be visits to two quarries - one at Upper Chicksgrove (Portland & Purbeck beds) and the Chalk pit at Quidhampton displaying remarkable solution pipes filled with Plateau Gravels.The structure of the vale will also be examined in exposures of Upper Greensand and Chalk.
