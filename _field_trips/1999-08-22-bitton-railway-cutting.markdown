This will be a joint meeting with the Bristol Naturalists' Society.

The main objective of the day will be to restore the magnificant exposure of Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic rocks in the old railway cutting at Bitton, near Bristol. This classic section was first recorded by Charles Moore in 1867.

Variable levels of activity, so work to suit everybody. Stout footwear and gloves are advisable and participants are welcome to bring hand tools; trowels, secateurs and brushes. Some tools will be provided by the organiser. Packed lunch and plenty to drink if you are planning to stay all day.

Meet at 10.30am at Bitton Railway Station.
