Black Mountain: this day comprises a traverse across the Black Mountain, at the western end of the Brecon Beacons National Park, and north of the Coalfield. The traverse provides a complete section from the base of the Coal Measures down through the Namurian Millstone Grit, the Carboniferous Limestone and the Old Red Sandstone to upper Silurian rocks.The localities display a range of sedimentary rock types and facies, including goniatite-bearing shales, quartzite with plant impressions, conglomerate, fossiliferous limestone, and fossiliferous shallow marine storm deposits. It may be possible to fit in a very quick visit to Carreg Cennen Castle (people should bring English Heritage membership cards if they have them). Lunch can be at a pub or at tea-rooms or a picnic - your choice.

Gower: the Gower Peninsula, west of Swansea, was Britain's first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The southern and western coastlines are formed of dramatic cliffs separated by sandy bays. There is a close relationship between geology and scenery, with hills and bays controlled by the distribution of Carboniferous Limestone, Millstone Grit and Old Red Sandstone. Most of the day will be spent at 2 localities - Rhossili and Caswell Bay. Short walks at each locality will demonstrate the typical Gower scenery, the relationship between geology and scenery, and the Carboniferous and Quaternary palaeoenvironments of the area. Lunch will probably be at Rhossili where there is a pub and tea-shops.

Meet in time for dinner at our accommodation in Swansea (still to be determined). Bring strong, waterproof footwear and warm waterproof clothing. A safety helmet will be useful for one locality on Saturday.
