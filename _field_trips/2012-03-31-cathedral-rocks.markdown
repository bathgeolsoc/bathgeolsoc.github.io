1.30pm - meet in the cloister corner in the west corridor by the main visitor entrance to the Cathedral and model of Old Sarum - to save time people should make their donation (requested voluntary donations Adults £5.50; Seniors / Students £4.50; Groups £4.50) at the desk before meeting up.

15 - 20 minutes introduction to the Cathedral with a look at the main building materials in situ. People would then be free to look round on their own.

3.00pm - Make your way to Salisbury & South Wilts Museum (across the Close from the Cathedral about 200 metres). There will be no charge for entering the museum but there is an expectation that people who wish to visit the general exhibits would pay the normal entry fee. There is a very nice cafe in the museum and also one in the Cathedral. You should make your way to the Lecture Hall for:

3.20pm - Talk about the building stones of Salisbury Cathedral

4.20pm - Questions

5.00pm or before if all done - all depart as the Salisbury & South Wilts Museum closes at this time.
