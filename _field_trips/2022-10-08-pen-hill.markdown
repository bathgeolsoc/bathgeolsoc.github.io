<p>A (~ 4km) walk around the southern slopes of Pen Hill where there are rocks from four geological periods â€“ Devonian, Carboniferous, Triassic and Jurassic.</p>

<p>There is an old quarry in a private garden with outcrops of the CDL showing a bed with an erosive base and another bed with probable stromatolite/algal mats. We will also see a narrow gulley showing red Mercia mudstone overlain by a thin green mudstone layer (Blue Anchor?) and then into Triassic lsts (White Lias). Further up the track is another quarry but this time in a Blue Lias sequence. Not many places to see this transition in the Mendips.</p>
<p>At the start there is a very nice valley (called The Combe and owned by large house Milton Lodge). There are some Triassic conglomerates exposed in upper part of the valley.</p>
<p>One negative point, the group would have to cross the trunk road (A39) three times where there is no speed restriction!</p>
