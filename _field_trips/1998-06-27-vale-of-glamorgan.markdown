The Vale of Glamorgan is the area between Porthcawl and Cardiff, south of the South Wales Coalfield and bordering the Bristol Channel. Here Upper Palaeozoic rocks are unconformably overlain by Mesozoic (Triassic and Jurassic) rocks. We will visit sites at Ogmore-by-Sea, Southerndown and Barry, and we should see spectacularly fossiliferous Carboniferous Limestone, marginal Triassic deposits with good sedimentary structures, marginal and open marine Lower Jurassic rocks with bivalves and ammonites, several unconformities, folding & faulting, and dinosaur footprints and trackways. Moderate level of activity.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at the sea-side car park in Ogmore-by-Sea at G.R. 862752; (entrance to car park leaves the B4524 at 864756). At the south (far) end of the car park a gate opens on to the coast path: meet near here. You will need sturdy footwear, and hard hats for Southerndown (after lunch). There is a pub and tea-shops where we will be for lunch, or you could bring a packed lunch.
