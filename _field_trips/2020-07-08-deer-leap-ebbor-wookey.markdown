The first BGS field trip, held fifty years ago, was to Ebbor Gorge. Our return visit this year includes Deer Leap and Wookey Hole.

The morning (2 – 2.5 hours) will be spent in the Deer Leap area, near Ebbor Gorge. This area is on the southern limb of the North Hill pericline where a sequence from Lower into Upper Carboniferous (the only Coal Measures outcropping in the southern Mendips) is exposed. The Ebbor thrust (part of the Wells-Cheddar thrust belt), juxtaposing the youngest Carboniferous Limestone unit (Black Rock Lst) against the youngest - the Coal Measures will be crossed, and the only exposure of this thrust that has been recorded will be seen. Then picnic lunch stop at Deer Leap, which has great views south across the Levels.

The afternoon will involve a stop at Ebbor Gorge to view the remains of a coal shaft that was sunk into the Coal Measures back in 1871! Then the rest of the trip will be spent around the Wookey Hole area looking at tectonic (normal fault/shear zones, extensional veins), and karst features in the Carboniferous Limestone and Triassic rocks.

Meet at 10.00 a.m. in the car park at Deer Leap (ST 5190 4928; 51.24064 -2.690464) – note this is a different car park from the one at the National Trust Ebbor Gorge. Bring a picnic lunch.
