This field trip visits two important Upper Triassic sites in South Gloucestershire representing arid coastal, shallow marine and lagoonal environments. There is an abundant marine fauna, particularly bivalves and the Westbury beds are renowned for their fish and reptile remains - particularly isolated teeth and bones.

The National Grid will be undertaking repair works on their pylon during mid-September and removing talus from the Aust cliff section alongside the concrete causeway - so there may be some disruption to our visit. Simon will bring material from his own collection that he has found at both sites.
