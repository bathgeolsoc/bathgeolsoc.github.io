Stancombe Quarry works within the Clifton Down Limestones of the Carboniferous Limestone Series. The strata are well jointed and dip north by about 20 degrees (forming the northern limb of the Broadfield Down pericline). In the south of the quarry the Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate outcrops. The quarry is cut by several E-W trending faults/mineral veins from which small specimens of galena can commonly be found. The quarry itself produces about 1.5 million tonnes of limestone each year most of which goes to produce concrete or building blocks and some of which is used to make asphalt. The quarry opened in the early 1950's.
