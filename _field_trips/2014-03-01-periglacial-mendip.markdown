Trip to consider evidence for periglacial features on Mendip. The Western Mendip special Geological Sheet is useful. The day can be split into two parts:-
The morning is on an exposed hillside and involves several strenuous styles. We shall consider visible evidence for the periglacial features comparing them with a known area of periglacial Karst in Canada. Cars will be moved to consider a separate area where a cave development is under loess.

Meet 10 am at car park at ST519492 on the Priddy Wookey lane on Pelting Drove.

In the afternoon, we shall examine features in Ebor Gorge. There is one style but steep paths.

Meet at 2pm at the NT car park ST521482
