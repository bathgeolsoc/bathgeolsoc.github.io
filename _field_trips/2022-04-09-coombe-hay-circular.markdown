This trip will be a guided 5-mile circular walk from Odd Down to Combe Hay to Midford to Tucking Mill to Horsecombe Vale via Southstoke and back to Odd Down.

It is a walk-through pleasant landscape with pretty views and some outcrops of the Middle Jurassic: Bridport/Midford Sands and the Inferior Oolite around Midford.

There will be lots of history related to the geology;
* We will pass old Fullerâ€™s Earth workings, near the P&R
* Great Oolite mines and quarries
* Sections of the Somerset Coal Canal (SCC) with its old locks (finished 1805)
* Route of the Limpley Stoke to Camerton railway which replaced the canal in the 1882, and the Bath to Bournemouth railway (Somerset & Dorset line, 1862-1966), all providing insights into the industrial heritage of the area.
* We will also be in the area where William Smith conducted some of his early surveys for the route of the SCC after which he produced his first map: the Geology of 5 miles around Bath (1799) and realised the significance of fossils in biostratigraphy.
* We will also see the house where Smith lived in Tucking Mill.

The walk will be on footpaths, tracks and minor roads (care needed); there may be some mud if recent rain. There are some hills and slopes. The William Smith Trail, produced by the Combe Down Heritage Society with input from the Bath Geological Soc (2016), covers part of this walk
