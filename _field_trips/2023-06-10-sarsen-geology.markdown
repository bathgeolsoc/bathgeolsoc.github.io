The field excursion will be entirely on foot and will consist of two circuits.  The first will be of 6 miles over Fyfield Down/Clatford Bottom north (a rare geomorphological SSSI) in the morning.  The lunch break will be taken at ‘The Who'd A Thought It’ pub (Wadsworth ales) in Lockeridge.  The second circuit will be around Lockeridge Dene (National Trust) of 2 miles.  If there is interest and energy, an additional walk could be added to the adjacent West Woods, the recently claimed source of the Stonehenge sarsens.
