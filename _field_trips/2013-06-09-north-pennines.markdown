The North Pennines is an AONB, and has a varied and interesting geology dominated by rocks of Carboniferous age; this is recognised in the area being designated as a UNESCO European and Global Geopark. The field trip will examine the Carboniferous succession, its famous Pb-Zn and fluorite mineral deposits, the intrusion of the Whin Sill and its contact metamorphism, and the general tectonics of the region. The trip will involve walks of varying round trip distances of up to 8 - 10km and involve some scrambles such as at Cauldron Snout and ascents/descents of ~ 200m. All participants should be able and suitably equipped to tackle such walks.
Provisional itinerary:

Day 2: Geology of Weardale area, visiting Killhope lead mining museum, Allenheads, Stanhope, Frosterly, and the sill at Holwick Scars and Low Force. Some of the features to be examined are shown in North Pennines Geology and Landscape.

Day 3: Geology of Cross Fell Inlier area and Eden Valley, visiting Dufton, Knock, High Cup Nick and the Penrith sandstone at Brough. Some of the features of this area are given in Geology and Landscape around Dufton and the Knock Geological Trail

Day 4: Geology of the Lune valley, examining the Silurian on the northern slopes of the Howgill fells, the unconformably overlying Carboniferous Visean succession starting with basements beds, followed by the various limestone units with thin storm beds, and overlying Ash Fell sandstone.

There is a maximum number of participants of 17, with 14 as the minimum for the trip viability. The accommodation is very popular and so it is essential to make a confirmed reservation. Once individual reservations are made and deposit paid, cancellations can only be refunded if the minimum number of participants is reached, and so all participants should arrange travel insurance.

Accommodation: Fawcett Mill Fields , is a converted mill dating back to the 16th Century. The mill is sited in a secluded setting in Raisbeck valley, but is only 3 km from the M6 Junction 38 (Tebay). The accommodation is self-catering (apart from the first night). Accommodation is available in double rooms, twin rooms and one single room. The accommodation cost is estimated to be between £135 - £165 per person for the five days, depending on the number of participants. The evening meal will be provided with the accommodation on the first night. The accommodation has good self-catering facilities and for the remainder of the period people are able to cater individually or on a group basis, or use local venues for meals - participants should make their preference known on booking sheet.

Travel arrangements - there are two options:
1. Participants are to arrange their own travel to/from the accommodation venue, aiming to arrive at Fawcett Mills Field at 18:00 on the Sunday. Travel for the field days will be via shared transport.
Anyone wishing to offer transport to others or seeking to share transport should make details known to the leader at the time of reservation.

2. Rental of a minibus with group travel. Depending on demand a 12 or 17 seater minibus could be rented, and a rough estimate of cost would be between £55 - 75 (inclusive of rental cost and fuel) per person depending on vehicle type and number of passengers. Which of the two options will be used, depends on the preferences of those making reservations and details will be circulated once all reservations and the trip are confirmed.
