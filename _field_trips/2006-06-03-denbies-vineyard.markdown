Surrey, in general, and Dorking in particular, has a long association with wine. Several vineyards flourished in the county during the Little Ice Age of the 17th and 18th centuries, notably at Painshill, Albury and Deepdene. In the last century vineyards were planted near Dorking at Thorncroft and Denbies. Denbies covers some 104 hectares (260 acres) and is believed to be the largest vineyard in Europe. It is planted with 19 different cultivars, and produces a range of red, white and sparkling wines. On this trip we will have a look at the geology of the vineyard and have a chance to sample some of the wines.

Meet at 10.30 am at Denbies Winery car park, one mile N. of Dorking on the A24 (TQ163511). Fuller details at <a href="www.denbiesvineyard.co.uk" target="_blank">www.denbiesvineyard.co.uk</a>
