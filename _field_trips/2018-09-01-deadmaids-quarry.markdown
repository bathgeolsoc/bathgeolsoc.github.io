Come and help clear vegetation on this SSSI which shows the transition from Upper Greensand to Lower Chalk. All details of geology at <a href="http://www.thegcr.org.uk/SiteReports.cfm?Step=3v">http://www.thegcr.org.uk/SiteReports.cfm?Step=3v</a>

The work we did last year has remained and we want to continue to clear the ivy growth. Bring gardening gloves, secateurs, long handled clippers, short brush, trowel and any short ladder would be appreciated. A hard hat and eye protection is a good idea too. You may get a bit dusty.

Park just beside the location at the back of the trading estate. Access from the north side of the B3092 (old A303) west of Mere, and just before the turnoff of the B3095 signed to Gillingham.

Pub lunch after. Interesting area if you are not familiar with the Mere fault.

Meet at 10 am at the Dead Maid Quarry Industrial Estate, Mere (ST 803 324).
