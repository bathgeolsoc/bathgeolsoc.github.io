The Corallian limestone aquifer rises to the surface at Wootton Bassett where it collects rainwater. There is sufficient hydrostatic pressure at the lowest part of the adjacent downfold to cause upward movement of water through the overlying Ampthill Clay which becomes liquefied, emerging at the surface as mud springs. The Swindon railway cutting (SSSI) displays the Upper Jurassic Portlandian sequence and is very fossiliferous.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at G.R. SU 071815, SE of Wootton Bassett, near the road to Broad Town. After crossing the railway, there is a track to the left, with adjacent car park, just at the edge of the town.
