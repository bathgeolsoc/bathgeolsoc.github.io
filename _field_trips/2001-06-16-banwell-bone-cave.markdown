'The Caves' is the name of an early 19th century house and gardens. There are 2 caves in the grounds, The Stalactite Cave and the Bone Cave. The Bone Cave is part of the Banwell SSSI and is filled by sands containing a large and varied Pleistocene mammalian fauna up to 80,000 years old. The cave chamber is about 10m across and contains the fossilised remains of at least 12 different types of vertebrate, primarily mammals, including prehistoric elephants, woolly rhinoceros, bears and cave lions. It is thought that within the last Ice Age, these animals fell into the cave through a large hole in the roof and died.

Meet at 10:30 a.m. in the car park (ST 385589). From the A371 take the Christon Road on the Weston super Mare side of Banwell village. Follow this lane up to the top of the hill and 'The Caves' is on the left hand side. Access is free but donations towards further restoration are appreciated. Bring a picnic.
