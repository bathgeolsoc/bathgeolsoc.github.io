Wickwar Quarry is in Carboniferous Limestone with Black Rock to Clifton Down Limestones - lots of fossils - brachiopods, corals, stromatolites, shark teeth...

Quartzite Quarry is also Carboniferous; the vertical section exposed reveals the Visean Hotwells Group (including the Upper Cromhall Sandstone) to the Namurian Quartzitic Sandstone Group - lots of marine fossils again and some plant fragments.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at Quartzite Quarry, ST 689899. We shall then travel to Wickwar Quarry, ST 714900. Hard hats, stout footwear essential.
