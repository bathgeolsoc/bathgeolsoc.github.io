This trail runs from Kidderminster to Bridgnorth. Steaming through geological time on the Severn Valley Railway. In the comfort of a railway carriage, you will encounter landscapes created in hot, dry deserts, steamy tropical swamps and exceedingly cold Ice Age conditions. You will see how the underlying rocks and the erosive effects of the river have influenced the landscape.

The plan is to arrive at Kidderminster to catch the 10:25 train which arrives at Bridgnorth at 11:34. After a leisurely lunch and maybe a stroll around the town we will return on the 14:45 arriving back at Kidderminster at 15: 52.

We need a party of 15 or more adults to qualify for a group discount on this trip (£12.95 instead of £15.50 for adults).
