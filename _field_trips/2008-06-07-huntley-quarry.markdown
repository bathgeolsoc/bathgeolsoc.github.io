For over 180 years, geologists have been arguing over the date of this very small quarry nestling in the side of May Hill. The quarry contains the only known exposure of the Huntley Quarry Beds. These volcaniclastic sediments, sandstones with volcanic material, have been subject to intense tectonic activity due to the close proximity of the regionally important Blaisdon Fault. This fault is very well displayed in the quarry, as is the folding and distortion of the Huntley Quarry Beds themselves. Importantly, the age of the sediments is still unknown with a possible age range of 570 Ma to 436 Ma having being postulated.

On this visit, the Huntley Quarry Beds and the Blaisdon Fault can be examined and there will be the opportunity to see the newly exposed Lower Silurian Bright's Hill Quarry.

Meet at 10.30 at the car park of County Garden Centre (next to Huntley Church) about 1 mile west of Huntley on A40 - GR SO 7100 1955
Parking can be either at the garden centre, by the church or in a little lane next to the school and church.
The activity will be quite strenuous as there are a couple of short sharp climbs. Most of the walking will be on rough ground with some country lanes for respite.

Strong footwear (wellies recommended if wet) and waterproofs required. It can be very muddy in the quarry and some of the short sharp climbs can be a little slippery, so some people (especially those who are a little unsteady on their feet) might want to bring sticks.
Packed lunches optional � there is a café and toilets at the Garden Centre.
