The old quarry faces exhibit a wide range of features which make the hill one of the best geological sites in Somerset. We will follow the Lime Kiln Trail and look at the Northern Quarry faces. A booklet 'Ham Hill; the Rocks and Quarries' by Hugh Prudden is available.

Meet at 10:30 a.m. at Lime Kiln car park, Ham Hill Country Park, 5 miles west of Yeovil, clearly visible from the A303.
