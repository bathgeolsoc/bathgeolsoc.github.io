Both quarries are SSSI sites in the middle Jurassic. Huntsman’s Quarry is famous for its exposure of ‘Cotswold slate’ (Eyford Member). These yield a rich and diverse collection of fossils - turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, fish, starfish, insects, ammonites and many more. Footprints of Megalosaurus have been found. A geological leaflet will be available. Hornsleasow Quarry is a microvertebrate site and fossiling here requires sieving. However, effort is rewarded as salamanders, frogs, turtles, crocodiles, pterosaurs, dinosaurs, lizards, Sterognathus, mammals and more can be found.

Meet at 10.00 a.m. at Huntsman’s Quarry, Buckle Street, Naunton, Cheltenham GL54 3BA, SP124255. From here we shall travel to Hornleasow Quarry, SP133323. Strong boots are essential. We can provide hard hats and reflective jackets but please bring your own if have them. A packed lunch will also be required.
