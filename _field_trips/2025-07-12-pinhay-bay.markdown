**Pinhay Bay, Dorset**  

**Saturday 12th July 2025**  

**11:00 – circa 15:00** (exact timings tbc)  

**Leaders:** Maurice Tucker & Eric Squires

### FIELD EXCURSION SUMMARY

The trip will examine the exceptional section of the White Lias (Langport Member of the Rhaetic Lilstock Formation) exposed in the cliffs about 2km to the SW of Lyme Regis, and the insights it provides into the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. This visit builds on the 2024 BGS Journal articles by Maurice Tucker and Eric Squires.

As low tide is expected around 14:00 BST, it should be feasible to walk to Pinhay Bay partly along the Blue Lias ledges, which are generally easier than the coarse beach. Note, however, that traversing the cobble beach can be strenuous and there are no facilities until you return to the car park.

Further details will be published in due course. Early expressions of interest or firm reservations are appreciated.
