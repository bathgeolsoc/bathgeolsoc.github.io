Frogden Quarry is one of the few remaining where the Inferior Oolite (Bajocian) is quarried. It is noted for its ammonites and other fossils and collecting is allowed. As it is a working quarry visitors are required to wear high visibility jackets, safety helmets and boots. 

The leader John Whicher has very extensive knowledge of the Inferior Oolite in the Somerset and Dorset Areas particularly in relation to the circumstances of its deposition and its fossil fauna. 

Anyone interested in joining the meeting is asked to contact Richard Ashley richardwashley@gmail.com or tel: 01934838850. They will then be supplied with details of how to join the meeting and papers relating to the site. Car sharing arrangements will be encouraged.
