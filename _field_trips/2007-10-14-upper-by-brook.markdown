The By Brook valley cuts deeply down into the southern Cotswold Hills as a result of slow but steady uplift of the land. The river cuts down through three Jurassic rock formations, Forest Marble, Great Oolite and Fuller's Earth. The rocks represent a variety of shallow marine sub-tropical sea floor environments of the mid-Jurassic sea which covered this part of Europe around 170 million years ago. This trail shows how geology is linked to the activities of the people living here. The water-bearing permeable Cotswold limestones are the source of the rivers and the fast-flowing waters of the By Brook have been utilised since Roman times. Over the centuries they have powered a number of mills by turning water wheels which drove machinery, originally grinding corn into flour.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. near Giddeahall, G.R. ST859747, at the junction of the A420 with the road signed to Slaughterford. Strong shoes, waterproofs and packed lunches are required.
