<strong>Field Trip Description:</strong> The trip will be a 5km circular walk starting and finishing in Winsley, visiting the disused Murhill quarry, inclined tramway, K&A canal, Avoncliff aqueduct, tufa spring and pumping station, Turleigh Trows spring and a few geological features in walls around Winsley.

The morning will start at the Murhill quarry looking at the old workings. Then we will descend to the canal via the route of the old tramway. A few of the original rails can be seen near the wharf where the stone was loaded onto barges on the Kennet and Avon canal. From here we will walk to Avoncliff along the canal towpath.

At Avoncliff we will examine a tufa spring near the railway station and the old pumping house which depending on time we may visit before or after lunch. There are benches on the Aqueduct for a lunch stop, refreshments and toilets are also available at the Cross-Guns public house.

The afternoon will involve walking uphill to Turleigh where the Trows Spring occurs at the boundary of the Fullers Earth and Great Oolite. Our route back through Winsley takes us past some Sponge Stone arches and ammonites incorporated into a wall.

<strong>Meet</strong> at 10.30 a.m. in Winsley. (Details given on Registration)

<strong>Bring a picnic lunch.</strong>

<strong>Health and Safety:</strong> Uneven conditions exist on some footpaths and suitable footwear is advised. The descent on the Murhill tramway is steep (1 in 4) however the surface is tarmac and we will take it slowly. The route backup to Winsley is more gradual, the ascent is 120m.
