Please join us for an informal Xmas Zoom get together.

Raise your glass with us and celebrate the close of 2020. We will try out a short geological Zoom photo quiz and a game of ‘higher or lower’. No pressure to participate, we just want to encourage contact and conversation at the end of what has been a difficult year.
