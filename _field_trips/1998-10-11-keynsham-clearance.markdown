This classic section of highly fossiliferous Lower Jurassic is within a short distance of Keynsham town centre. The clearance will involve work with spades and saws and some lifting and carrying of rocks will be necessary. If you enjoy a bit of hard (and dirty) work then this is for you. Wear old, warm clothes and sturdy boots. Some tools will be provided.

Meet 10.30 a.m. at Somerdale Picnic Area, Keynsham, at the side of the Keynsham road (A4175) and opposite the Avon Mill Lane turning. Please bring a packed lunch. Further information from Simon Carpenter, 0117 9604 093.
