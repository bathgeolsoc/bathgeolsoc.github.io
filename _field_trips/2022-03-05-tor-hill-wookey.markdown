A visit to both Tor Woods (just east of Wells) & Wookey Hole Caves. 

Tor Woods is classified a Special Landscape Feature by Mendip Council and we will have the opportunity to examine an exposure which provides insights into the famous Wells springs.

At Wookey Hole we will use a new access tunnel to explore the 20th Chamber of the caves which features what is regarded as the best example of fluting in the UK due to their unusual extent and size.

Please register your attendance by the end of January latest.
