Lulworth Cove is a classic geological section of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Highlights include the spectacular bay itself, Stair Hole and the Fossil Forest. At Lulworth we will see the Upper Jurassic - Cretaceous strata: tectonics, stratigraphy, sedimentology and palaeontology. The Portland limestone and Purbeck beds show oolites, stromatolites, collapse breccias from evaporite dissolution, lacustrine limestones with bivalves and gastropods; the overlying Wealden consists of fluvial sandstones (some impregnated with oil) and palaeosoils. The Greensand and the Chalk at the back of the Bay contain fossil echinoids, bivalves and serpulids. There are also spectacular folds and faults, at Stair Hole in particular.

There is much to see geologically around Lulworth Cove itself, but we will then walk along the Southwest Coastal Path to the east across the army firing range towards Mupe Bay. This 2-mile stretch is described as moderate and strenuous on the Jurassic Coast website and Mupe Bay as an "ideal spot for those who like their coastline wild, rugged and just a little bit dangerous!" ​ ​We will avoid the dangerous parts. There are some steps to climb to get out of Lulworth Cove. We hope at least to view the fossil forest from above, if access is still an issue following the cliff fall in 2015.

<strong>Meet at the Lulworth Cove car park at 10.30 am.</strong>
