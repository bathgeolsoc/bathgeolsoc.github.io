Fossils can be collected from Wiltshire Geology Group's canal-side excavation of a Jurassic hard-ground seafloor surface at Bradford on Avon marina. We will then look at a few nearby buildings (Ancliff Oolite and Bath or Combe Down Oolite building stone) walking along the canal to Avoncliff. In Becky Addy wood there is another Forest Marble site (rather steep access) where there are fossils and Ancliff Oolite building stone. There is the old Combe Down Oolite quarry above the aqueduct, plus a good pub! There is some Inferior Oolite too on the opposite side of the aqueduct.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at the Bradford-on-Avon Marina (next to British Waterways car park) picnic site information board. Some people could drive and park at Avoncliff if they don't want to walk so far (about 2 miles).
