Extensive coal basins underlie much of the Bristol-Bath district, mostly concealed by younger rocks, but locally cropping out. Exposures in the mudrock-dominated Lower and Middle Coal Measures are very rare but have been, and continue to be, exploited for brick making at Ibstock's Cattybrook quarry and factory near Almondsbury. On this trip these strata, strongly disturbed during the Hercynian Orogeny, will be examined and the business described. Up to one million bricks a week can be produced at the factory.

Meet at 10.30 am at the entrance to the quarry on the B4055, about 2 km SW of the M4-M5 Almondsbury interchange at ST829593. Bring boots.
