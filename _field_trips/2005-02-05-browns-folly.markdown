We shall be joined by members of The Wildlife Trust for our annual clear-up of the geological sites on this SSSI Reserve. Come along with gardening tools or just take the opportunity to visit the sites and talk to Ron Smith about the geology.

Variable levels of activity depending on what you decide to do! There are some steep slopes; strong shoes and hard hats essential.

Meet at 11.00 a.m. Brown's Folly Car Park (ST 798694).
