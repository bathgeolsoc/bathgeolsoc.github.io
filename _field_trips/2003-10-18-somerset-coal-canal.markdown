We shall walk the route of William Smith's haulage way from Combe Down to Tucking Mill (geological section); then along the canal up through Midford to the Rowley Wood lock flight and on to Combe Hay. We shall see a section of the railway line that replaced the canal. Finally we shall walk back to South Stoke via the ridge top and the impressive Parish Millennium Viewpoint with its superb 180 degree panorama.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at Combe Down Parish Church (Holy Trinity, Church Road). Transport will be arranged at South Stoke for return to Combe Down or nearby bus stops. Some rough ground so suitable footwear is needed, preferably walking boots. Bring a picnic lunch. The day will end at about 3.30 p.m.
