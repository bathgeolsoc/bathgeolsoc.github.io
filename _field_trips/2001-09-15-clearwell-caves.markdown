Clearwell Caves are part of an extensive network of ancient iron mines which completely surround the edge of the Forest of Dean. The mines at Clearwell are the only working ochre mines in the British Isles. The mines are part of a natural cave system and you will be able to visit the nine impressive caverns descending 31m (100ft) beneath the surface. There are mining and geological displays, an engineering workshop, ochre preparation room and blacksmith's shop. There is a Mine Shop and Tearoom.

If you wish you can join the <strong>Deep Level Trip</strong> - crawling, climbing and getting dirty but great fun! Ask for more details about this.

Meet at 10:00 a.m. at OS Grid Ref. SO 576082. The caves are 1.5miles from Coleford town centre. Follow the B4228 in the direction of St. Briavels and Chepstow. After about 1 mile, turn right for Clearwell (just past the Lambsquay Hotel). The sign for the coach and car park is clearly visible after a few hundred yards.
