We shall be looking at the relics of coal mining in the area and then proceed to Huckford Quarry (disused) where Pennant Sandstone is exposed

Meet at 2.00p.m. "The Garden Shop"(ST669802) where the A432 Bristol to Chipping Sodbury Road goes under the Railway at Coalpit Heath (south side). We will meet in a marquee in the site where Trevor Thompson will give a short presentation on the industrial archaeology and geology of the area. Coffee will be provided but there will be a fee of Â£3 per head for this and the use of the facilities. We expect to finish at about 4.30p.m. Hard hats are not necessary - members own choice.
