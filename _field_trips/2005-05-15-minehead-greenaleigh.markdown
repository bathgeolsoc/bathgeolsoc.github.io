We shall take a short walk along the prom to consider sea defences and beach restoration and there will be a brief review of what is below the Bristol Channel. We shall also walk through the woods to Greenaleigh to examine head deposits, the arcuate shingle ridge, Variscan/Tertiary tectonics and Devonian sediments.

Meet at 10.30a.m. Harbour Car Park, Minehead by the Lifeboat Station.
