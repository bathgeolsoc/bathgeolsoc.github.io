We will have an introductory talk at the Somerset Earth Science Centre, explore Moon's Hill Quarries i.e the Silurian volcanics and the Devonian Old Red Sandstone. Next we will visit Fairy Cave Quarry (Carboniferous Limestone) and St. Dunstan's Well - a karst spring rising below the quarry. Then, finally, we will look at the tufa deposits in Harridge Wood.

Meet at the Somerset Earth Science Centre, Stoke St. Michael, near Radstock at 10.00 for 10.30 a.m. Tea/coffee available on arrival. A minibus will be available for transport to the nearby Fairy Cave Quarry. We will then return to the Centre for our packed lunches. In the afternoon, the minibus will be available for those who wish to use it for the visit to Harridge Wood. Others may wish to take their own cars and depart after the visit to this location.
