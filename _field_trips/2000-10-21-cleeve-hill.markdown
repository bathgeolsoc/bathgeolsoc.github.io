This will be a joint meeting with the Western Region of the Geological Society.

We will look at the sequence of Inferior Oolitic Limestones from the Scissum Beds up through the Freestones and into the Middle Inferior Oolite and through that series ending with the very rare Phillipsiana beds. We then see the capping Upper Inferior Oolite of Trigonia Grit and Clypeus Grit. There is also ample oportunity to view the Worcester Graben and surrounding Geomorphology.

Meet at 11.00 am and take a packed lunch. Meet in the car park on the Common, grid reference 989272 which is in an old quarry on the common just by the Golf Course Clubhouse. Follow signs for the Golf Course. Please do not park in the Golf Club carpark or on the main A46 roadside.
