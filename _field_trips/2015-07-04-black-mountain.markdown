The Black Mountain (Mynydd Du) is the western part of the Brecon Beacons. It lies within the Fforest Fawr Geopark and the Brecon Beacons National Park and is traversed by the Beacons Way. The geology comprises gently southward-dipping Palaeozoic strata on the north side (“North Crop”) of the South Wales Coalfield, ranging in age from late Silurian to late Carboniferous. As befits its location within the National Park, the area is scenically attractive, with extensive views to the south over the industrialised South Wales Coalfield and to the north into rural mid Wales. Although outside the area of coal-bearing rocks, the area contains an important legacy of extractive industries and associated infrastructure.

This field meeting will comprise a traverse of the Black Mountain from Brynamman in the south towards Llangadog in the north. The major units of the succession will be examined from youngest to oldest, including the “Farewell Rock” at the base of the South Wales Coal Measures, the Bishopston Mudstone Formation (“Shale Group”) and Twrch Sandstone (“Basal Grit”) of the Marros Group (“Millstone Grit”), the Carboniferous Limestone, Old Red Sandstone, and marine Silurian rocks. The traverse provides excellent examples of sedimentary features indicative of changing palaeoenvironments, contrasting fossil assemblages, structural features of tectonic origin, and evidence of a variety of extractive industries, as well as a close relationship between geology and landscape.

Several sites will be visited, all close to parking places, although the ground conditions may be rough and wet underfoot in places. Bring warm, waterproof clothing and sturdy, waterproof footwear. Please bring a packed lunch. Safety helmets are advisable at one site.
