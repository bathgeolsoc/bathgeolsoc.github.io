We shall visit the caves in the morning and walk to Beer Head and Under Hooken Cliff in the afternoon. We shall have spectacular views of chalk cliffs, faulting and landslips.

Meet at 11.00 a.m. Turn off the A3052 Seaton-Sidmouth road on to the B3174 for Beer Village. The caves are about 1 mile to the west of the village. We may be able to organise a coach for this trip; details later. Hard hats and strong boots essential. Warm clothing is needed for the caves.
