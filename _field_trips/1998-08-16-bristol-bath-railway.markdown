Formerly the LMS Railway and now part of the National Cycle Network, the Bristol to Bath Railway Path provides a valuable geological resource and a means of exploring the fascinating prehistory of our area. All you need for this excursion is a bicycle (and a little effort) to enjoy a full day of geology and natural history in the Avon Valley. A number of outstanding rock outcrops of Carboniferous, Triassic and Jurassic age will be visited including two sites where clearance work has been undertaken and geological information boards installed. The use of local stone for the construction of the railway will also be discussed.
The path is an important wildlife corridor linking country and city areas of Bristol and Bath. It crosses the River Avon in several places and provides outstanding views across the Avon Valley.

General details: Leisurely bicycle ride covering a return distance of approximately 10 miles on a tarmac path. Ideal for all ages. Bring waterproofs, just in case it rains. No hammers required. Lunch/refreshments at the Bird in Hand Public House (next to the Railway path at Saltford). Hot and cold meals (or bring your own sandwiches), cycle parking and garden available here.

Meet at Grid Ref. 670708 Bitton Railway Station car park at 10.30am. (finishing about 4.00pm.). The station is situated on the Railway path for those arriving by bicycle from Bath or Bristol.
