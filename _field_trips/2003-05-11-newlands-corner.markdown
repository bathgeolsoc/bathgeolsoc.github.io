The trail involves a circular walk of 5 miles (8km) using quiet tracks and some minor roads. You will see a wide variety of underlying Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks, the part they play in forming the landscape, how the plants and animals depend on each particular rock type and how people have used the rocks.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at the Visitor Centre, Newlands Corner, about 3 miles east of Guildford - TQ 0449 (more details later). The walk is quite steep in parts and can be muddy and slippery after rain so walking boots or stout shoes are recommended. Geology Trail available at pounds 1.50 from Surrey RIGS Group.
