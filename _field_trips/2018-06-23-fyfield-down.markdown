This trip will examine the sarsen stones and landscape in the region of Fyfield Down.

Meet at 10 AM in the walkers car park up the lane on the north side of the A4 (signed 'Manton' or 'Manton House') just west of Marlborough: Grid ref. 159 700.
We will do a three hour circular walk of about 5 miles around Fyfield Down looking at sarsen stones, including Clatford Bottom and the Stone Age axe-polishing stone known as 'the polissoir'.

After a lunch break we will meet in Avebury outside the Red Lion Inn at 2:30 PM and spend an hour or two looking around Avebury and it's building stones. The estimated finish time will be 4 PM.

There is a National trust car park in Avebury (pay & display for non-members) and as well as the pub there is a cage by the tithe barn, so plenty of choice for refreshments.
