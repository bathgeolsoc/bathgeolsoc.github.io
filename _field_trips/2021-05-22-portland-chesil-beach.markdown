The plan is to visit the outcrops around Pulpit Rock and then walk up the spectacular east coast to Freshwater Bay, returning to the Bill via Sweet Hill and the medieval fields. We shall see 2 raised beaches from the last two interglacial times (125 and 250kyr), many coastal landforms (wave-cut platforms, blow-holes, sea-caves), the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Portland-Purbeck strata with fossils, microbiolites, and the effects and relicts of quarrying the Portland stone.

We will be walking on the wide coastal path â€“ mostly flat, a little rough, care needed. This is around 4 miles and with stops will take about 3 hours.

After a picnic lunch, we will visit the disused Tout Quarry, NW corner of the Island. Here we will see the Purbeck strata and spectacular views (visibility permitting) of Chesil Beach and the cliffs, relics of the quarrying industry, as well as the 50+ sculptures there in the old quarry.

Time (and enthusiasm) permitting, we will examine Chesil Beach at Chiswell to see its features close up and discuss its origin. Aim to finish 4:30pm.
