<ol><li>Chisbury Hill-fort: view of the wooded hills east of Savernake Forest, on the edge of the London Basin, where the Chalk is capped by a thin layer of Tertiary sands and clays.</li>
<li>Stype Wood: the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary is marked by solution hollows where streams running down over clayey Tertiary beds on the hill-top disappear when they get down to the porous/permeable Chalk below.</li>
<li>Littlecote quarry: a solution pipe in the top of the Chalk can be seen to be filled with Clay-with-Fints.</li>
<li>Kennet & Avon canal: the canal will we followed from Great Bedwyn westwards, passing the Crofton Beam Engine -built to pump water into the canal at its highest point. Nearby, to the west, the canal goes through the brick-lined Savernake tunnel as it enters the Vale of Pewsey.</li>
<li>Vale of Pewsey: we will look at the structure of the vale and how it affects the bounding Chalk escarpments, with a stop at a pit in the Melbourn Rock at the base of the Middle Chalk.</li></ol>

Meet at 11.00 a.m. Manor Farm Stud, Chisbury - SU 280 660. We have permission to park in the farmyard: turn right after going into the farm entrance and go round into yard area to park (south-east side of the house). Walk to the redundant church behind the buildings.

As this is some 35 miles from Bath, those who want to share cars to reduce the size of the convoy to the next 5 localities as well as save on petrol, could meet at 10.15 and park on Spa Road, Melksham (by the 3 big spa lodging houses) where we met up for the field trip 2 years ago, GR ST 914 628, (behind the roundabout on the A365 southeast of Melksham on the road to Devizes - take road towards town centre/hospital at that roundabout, then turn sharp right almost immediately). A member of the Bath G.S. committee will wait there until 10.15 a.m.

There will be a lunch stop in Great Bedwyn where there are two pubs. Hard hats and strong shoes will be required
