Coal mining was a major occupation in this area with the last pit closing in 1973. The walk is 4 miles/6km along roads and through fields and shows part of the history of the area, with fine views over the Mendip Hills. It is easy to moderate walking and takes about 2Â½ hours.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. in the car park in South Road, just off the High Street, Midsomer Norton. Strong shoes are required. Bring a picnic lunch if you wish but there are places for refreshment en route.
