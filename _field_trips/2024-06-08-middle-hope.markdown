The outcrops along the north coast of Middle Hope â€“ Sand Point, north of Weston Super Mare, show interbedded volcanic deposits and Lower Carboniferous limestones of the Black Rock Group. This is a rare occurrence in SW England but there were localised volcanoes at the time, more so in Derbyshire and the Midland Valley of Scotland. Good exposures reveal a variety of volcanic deposits, ash fall, ash flow, reworked tuffs and pillow lavas. The Carboniferous limestones contain corals, brachiopods and some beautiful burrows. There are Pleistocene raised beach deposits here too.

Walking out on an exposed grass-covered headland; rocky-sandy beach exposures, stout boots; bring packed lunch-coffee.

Meet at the National Trust carpark at 11 am, Post-code BS22 9UD.
