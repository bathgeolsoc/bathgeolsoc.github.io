Carboniferous Limestone in the huge disused Tintern Quarry demonstrates a marine withdrawal during the early Carboniferous: Crease Limestone (marine), Whitehead Limestone (pertidal with palaeokarst and probably palaeosols) and Drybrook Sandstone (fluviatile with calcrete palaeosol). In the Blackpool Valley, are the Trenchard and Pennant Formations and the exteriors of two coal mines. Parts of these Coal Measures sections have been extensively restored recently by Glos RIGS. This has re-exposed the Coleford High Delf seam (Seat Earth below).

Meet at 9.30 a.m. at SO 555987 in the car park about a mile south of Hewelsfield on the B4228 (this road joins the A48T in Tutshill). The day will end at 5.00 p.m.
