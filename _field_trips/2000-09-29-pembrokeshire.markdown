This excursion will be based at Twr-y-Felin Hotel, St David's. There are superb views of the St David's Peninsula and St Bride's Bay from the parapet of the old windmill which forms part of the hotel complex. The proceedings will commence with an introductory lecture.

On the first day of the excursion participants can walk along the Pembrokeshire Coast Path to view the classic features which are particularly well exposed in this beautiful coastline between Porthlyski and Caerbwdy Bay where the lower Cambrian sedimentary sequence is seen to rest unconformably on Precambrian igneous rocks. The relative ages of these rocks was the subject of a fierce controversy between Henry Hicks and Archibald Gieke. The total distance of the intended route is c. 9km (approx. 6 miles). There will be frequent, sometimes lengthy pauses to examine the numerous features of interest, but as the coastline is fairly rugged those wishing to complete the whole distance should be reasonably fit.

On the second day the Ordovician rocks of the North Pembrokeshire coast will be examined, including the layered gabbro of St David's Head, fossiliferous black slates at Abereiddi Bay, and the volcanic rocks of the Strumble Peninsula. It will be necessary to use cars to travel between these localtions and the total distance to be walked will not exceed 6km (c.4 miles) but is perhaps equally demanding. Alternatives can be suggested for those who wish to complete only part of either day's itinerary. The accomodation is within easy walking distance of Caerfai Bay and the centre of St David's, with its fine cathedral and a variety of shops.

Meet at Twr-y-Felin Hotel in time for dinner on Friday 29th September.
