We shall be looking at the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks of the Purbeck Monocline, from Portland and Purbeck Limestones, Wealden Clay, Upper Greensand to Chalk, covering about 80 million years of earth's history. After visiting Durdle Door, we will walk along the coastal path to Lulworth Cove and then round the Cove to the Fossil Forest.

Strong shoes are essential. Please bring packed lunch. It may be possible to arrange a mini bus depending on interest.
