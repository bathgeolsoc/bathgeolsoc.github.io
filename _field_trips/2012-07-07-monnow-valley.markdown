The trip will visit a number of localities along the Monnow to demonstrate:
<ul><li>the changing form of the valley as it enters the outcrop of different members of the Old Red Sandstone</li>
<li>the structural factors that have determined the course of the valley</li>
<li>the historical variations of geomorphological process that have determined both the course and form of the valley and channel.</li></ul>

Of course, this study will necessarily include consideration of the development of tributary valleys and nearby high ground, such as the Golden and Grey Valleys, The Sugar Loaf and Skirrid Fawr.

We shall meet at 11.00 a.m. at St. Maughan's Church car park SO461171. Car sharing is recommended as we shall be on narrow roads with restricted parking. Strong shoes and a packed lunch are required.
