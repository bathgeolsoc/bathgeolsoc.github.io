We shall have a morning walk east of Camerton and then a drive to lunch at Combe Hay, where there is a pub with excellent food. In the afternoon we shall walk around the canal at Combe Hay. There are a reasonable number of exposures spanning Mercia Mudstone to Inferior Oolite, plenty of canal features, coal mine remains and links with William Smith. Copies of relevant archive maps and documents will be provided.

Parking in spaces along local roads. Lunch at the pub in Combe Hay. Walking boots or strong shoes essential because of muddy paths.
