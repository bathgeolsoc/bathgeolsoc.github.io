This fieldtrip to South Wales will examine upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic sediments exposed along the coast to the SW of Cardiff. In the morning we will visit the controversial dinosaur footprints reported in the media (see BBC news online August 2020) and featured in the Channel 5 TV programme “Behind the Scenes at The Natural History Museum” broadcast last year. They are exposed in outcrops of Upper Triassic mudrocks on the beach 800 metres south of Penarth Pier. We will also see the red Mercia Mudstone with nodules of alabaster (Penarth ‘marble’) and Rhaetic and Lower Lias limestones and mudrocks, some with many fossils.  

In the afternoon we will drive 6 km to Bendrick Rock, near Sully, to see more dinosaur footprints, which were discovered in 1974 and are frequently in the news (last in January 2021 when a fine specimen was found by a 4-year old girl, also on BBC news online). Also here are many interesting sedimentary structures in the Triassic red beds, deposited by flash floods and streams, near the margin of a desert lake or playa where the Mercia Mudstone was deposited. These sediments lie unconformably on Carboniferous limestone.

<strong>Meet at Penarth Pier <u>at 10.30 am</u>. <u>Finish by 4.30 pm</u>.

Bring a packed lunch or there are cafés on the promenade and pier at Penarth.</strong>

At Penarth, we will be walking along the beach, which is stony in places. At Bendrick Rock we will be on a cliff path and across the rocks. Low risk and few hazards at both places.  

<strong>There is a free car park at Cliff Parade, Penarth, Postcode: CF64 5BP.

For Bendrick Rock use postcode CF63 3RF (for Barry Recycling Centre).
