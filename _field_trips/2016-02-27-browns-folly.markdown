This is our annual clear-up of the Geological sites on this SSSI reserve. Come along with gardening tools or just take the opportunity to visit the sites and talk about geology.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at Brown's Folly Car Park (G.R. ST 798663). Strong boots and waterproofs are required. Hard hats should be worn under or near exposures. Please bring one if you can; we do have some available.
