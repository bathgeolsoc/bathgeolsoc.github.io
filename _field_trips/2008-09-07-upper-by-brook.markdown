The By Brook valley cuts deeply down into the southern Cotswold Hills as a result of slow but steady uplift of the land. The river cuts down through three Jurassic rock formations; Forest Marble, Great Oolite and Fuller's Earth. This trail shows how geology is linked to the activities of the people living here.

Meet at 10.30am near Giddeahall GR ST 859747 just south west of the junction of the A420 with the road from Biddestone. Strong shoes, waterproofs and packed lunches are required.
