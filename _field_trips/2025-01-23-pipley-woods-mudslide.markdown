The will be a short (circa 2 hour) visit to view the recent mudslide located just off the Cotswold way near Pipley Woods Lansdown and discuss the depositional processes that are involved. A description of some of the features that can be observed can be found in Mauriceâ€™s article in the BGS January Newsletter. The visit will also provide the opportunity to look at adjacent outcrops of Great Oolite, Fullers Earth Rag (exposure in the track), and some likely Roman stone pits/ old quarries.

Please wear stout boots or wellington boots with good grip as the area around and within the mudslide is slippery with steep slopes (the Fullers Earth clay is very sticky stuff!). The current forecast is for light / occasional showers so waterproofs are required.

<strong>Meet at 11am (ready to start) at the Lansdown civil war monument car park which is located about 1km to the north of the entrance to the Bath Race Course (see map on following page). From here it is about a 2km walk along the Cotswolds Way to the mudslide. Following the trip there will be the option to visit the Charlcombe Inn for lunch.</strong>
