The party will examine the vertical, or steeply dipping, succession of Silurian (Wenlock) volcanic rocks exposed in the core of the Mendip-Beacon Hill pericline. Dr. Green has recently revised the 1:10,000 map for the new edition of the Frome (281) sheet and new exposures, as in the past, have continued to supply surprises!

Meet at 2.30 p.m. at the quarry office, (ST 663465).

Hard hats, stout shoes, reflective jackets essential.
