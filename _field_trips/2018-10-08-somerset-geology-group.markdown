10.15 -11.00 Geological museum collections in Somerset
Simon Carpenter will tell us about the Browne’s Hole Collection held at the Frome Museum, a geological and archaeological collection from a cave at Stoke St Michael in the Mendips, now a scheduled archaeological site. Simon will tell us about how the material is being curated and stored and show us a selection of the material and the backdrop from the exhibition held a few years ago. The site is close to St Dunstan’s Well SSSI (of geological interest for its cave system) and Cook’s Wood Quarry SSSI ( Carboniferous stratigraphy).

11.00 – 11.30 Coffee
11:30-12:15 Geological Site Conservation in Somerset
Review Somerset’s Local Geological Sites - presentation on progress with our SGG project with Somerset Environmental Record Centre and discussion on the next stages of the project. Plus a reminder that there are also a large number of geological SSSIs of national importance in Somerset (a potential theme to cover in more detail at a future meeting).

12.15 – 1pm Education, teaching use of sites and sharing information on events
13:00-14:00 Picnic lunch
Directions: The museum (https://fromemuseum.wordpress.com/) is in the centre of Frome, in the former Frome Literary and Scientific Institute, with the entrance from North Parade. The Cattle Market car park is immediately behind, while North Parade car park is less expensive and nearby but smaller: see http://www.mendip.gov.uk/paydisplay for a map and charges. Accessibility: there are a few steps up from the entrance into the gallery where will meet, but no major stairway.
