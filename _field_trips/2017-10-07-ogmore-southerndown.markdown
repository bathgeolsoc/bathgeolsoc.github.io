Mesozoic rocks unconformably overlie Upper Palaeozoic rocks in the Vale of Glamorgan. The rock units and their relationships are superbly exposed along the spectacular Glamorgan Heritage Coast. Highlights include richly fossiliferous Carboniferous Limestone and Blue Lias (early Jurassic); marginal facies of the Mesozoic that developed close to upstanding areas of Carboniferous Limestone and are preserved adjacent to unconformities in the form of wadi breccias and rocky shoreline deposits; a variety of styles of unconformity; and impressive folds and faults.

Meet at the car park at the south end of Ogmore-by-Sea village (SS 869 734) at 10.30 AM and later move to the car park at Dunraven Bay.

There is plenty of parking available but with pay-and-display fees at Ogmore and a toll at Southerndown. Strong footwear and packed lunch will be needed.
