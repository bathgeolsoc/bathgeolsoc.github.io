Robinswood Hill Country Park is a Jurassic outlier on the southern edge of the City of Gloucester, two miles from the City centre. One of the sites is an old quarry (SSSI) and is the best inland section of early Jurassic rocks in the country.

The walk is 3.5km and takes from 2hrs to 2hrs 30mins - longer if we stop to look. It is steep in places and paths are slippery when wet. Strong shoes, hard hats, warm, waterproof clothes and packed lunch are required.
