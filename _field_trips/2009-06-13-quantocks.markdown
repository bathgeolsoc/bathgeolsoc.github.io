Our ramble will take us over rocks of the eastern Quantocks, examining them in outcrop where we can, and using the best alternative where there are no exposures - the parish churches of the area. We will look at Devonian slates, Permian and Triassic conglomerates and sandstones and many others besides. We will finish by visiting Hestercombe House to see the exquisite Lutyens gardens and, hopefully, some lovely flowers, and the exposure and use of the Hestercombe diorite.

Meet at North Petherton cemetery ref. ST295335 at 10.30 a.m. From junction 24 of the M5, join the A38 by turning left (south) towards North Petherton. After just over 0. 75 miles, turn right - the cemetery is on the right after about 100 yds. Bring a packed lunch, hand lens and wear stout footwear. The localities will be approached by car but we will need to walk over rough ground for short distances.
