The Moon’s Hill quarries were last visited by the BGS in 2019. The site exposes a 300–400m thick sequence of andesites, rhyodacites, tuffs and agglomerates interbedded with tuffaceous shales and mudstones. These clastic and volcaniclastic sediments have yielded a rich, shelly fauna referrable to the Lower Wenlock Series (Sheinwoodian Stage), representing the sole example of Wenlock-aged volcanic rocks (apart from bentonites) in England.

Quarry tours will operate in groups of 10–12, constrained by the mini bus capacity. Our current reservation is for one mini bus, with the possibility of a second group subject to interest. Strong boots and appropriate waterproofs are essential.

Please note that the SEC requests a donation of £15 per participant.
