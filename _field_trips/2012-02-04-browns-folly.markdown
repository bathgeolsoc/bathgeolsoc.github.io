Brown’s Folly Nature Reserve consists of 91 acres of land on the hillside overlooking the valley of the River Avon about half a mile south-east of the village of Bathford. It is owned by the Avon Wildlife Trust and has been designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) because of the Middle Jurassic rocks, plants and wildlife that can be found there. Extensive limestone extraction on the reserve, largely by mining, was carried out in the past, the stone being used for building and known as Farleigh Stone. This activity, long discontinued, has left the rock exposed at many sites enabling it to be examined. The study of the different strata of rock and the fossils they contain has made it possible to establish when they were formed and to build up a picture of what the area would have looked like at the time. The walk lasts about two hours and takes you back in time about 160 million years.

The morning is also our annual clear-up of the Geological sites on this SSSI reserve. If you know the site well and do not want to join the tour, then please come along with gardening tools and help to keep the sites open for others.

Meet at 10.00 a.m. at Brown's Folly Car Park (G.R. ST 798663). Strong boots, waterproofs, hard hats are required.
