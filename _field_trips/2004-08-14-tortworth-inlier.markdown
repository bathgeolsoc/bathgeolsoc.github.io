The Tortworth inlier lies on the northern rim of the Bristol Coalfield and consists of Ordovician rocks in the northern part and Silurian rocks in the south. The Ordovician outcrop is largely unexposed but the Silurian can be examined at a few poor exposures. However, it is unusual in that two volcanic bands are present at the base of the sequence, which ranges from the Upper Llandovery to the top of the Wenlock.

We will examine the Silurian sequence where exposures allow and fill in the gaps with a "mobile exposure". There will be limited opportunities for collecting.

Meet at 10.30 am at Tortworth Church (ST 704934). Bring a packed lunch. Stout shoes or boots if wet.
