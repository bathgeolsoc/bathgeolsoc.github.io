ECOS (European Community of Stone) was an imaginative attempt to celebrate the European Union in 1998. The invitation went out to the nations involved in the first union to provide a monolith of stone to represent their country in an open-air amphitheatre at Frome. Foster Yeoman Ltd, the main local employer, provided the support and the services of their personnel manager, Peter Chapman. The stones stand in a commanding position and will be examined and discussed. Frome is a limestone town to compare and contrast with Bath.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at the Stones (details of exactly where later). There will be a tour of the building stones of Frome in the afternoon. Please bring a packed lunch.

Please note: This trip is followed by a lecture by Peter Chapman about ECOS on Thursday 7th August.
