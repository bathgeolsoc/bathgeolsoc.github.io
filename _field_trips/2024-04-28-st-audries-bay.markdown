To see the Upper Triassic through Lower Jurassic succession with changing environments from desert playa and alkaline lake through brackish water lagoons to shallow and then deeper-marine limestones and mudrocks. The Rhaetic succession (Lilstock Fm) also records deformed and disturbed bedding which may have resulted from a meteorite impact (2000 km west) and associated tsunami or intense seismic activity. There are faults and fractures too, relating to movement of salt at depth and/ or extensional and compressional tectonics during the later Mesozoic - Tertiary as a result of changes in regional stress patterns, opening of the Atlantic and Wessex Basin extension. Fossils are abundant in the Rhaetic and Liassic sediments, notably ammonites and bivalves, and trace fossils are well developed.

Walking along beach and foreshore rock exposures; stout boots and care needed.

In view of the tides, we will be meeting at <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">NOON</span> at the Holiday Park there (parking, café and facilities available). Post-code TA4 4DY, West Quantoxhead.
