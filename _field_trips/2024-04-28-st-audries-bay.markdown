To see the Upper Triassic through Lower Jurassic succession with changing environments from desert playa and alkaline lake through brackish water lagoons to shallow and then deeper-marine limestones and mudrocks. The Rhaetic succession (Lilstock Fm) also records deformed and disturbed bedding which may have resulted from a meteorite impact (2000 km west) and associated tsunami or intense seismic activity. There are faults and fractures too, relating to movement of salt at depth and/ or extensional and compressional tectonics during the later Mesozoic - Tertiary as a result of changes in regional stress patterns, opening of the Atlantic and Wessex Basin extension. Fossils are abundant in the Rhaetic and Liassic sediments, notably ammonites and bivalves, and trace fossils are well developed.

Walking along beach and foreshore rock exposures; stout boots and care needed.

In view of the tides, we will be meeting at <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">NOON</span> at the Home Farm Holiday Centre (parking, café and facilities available). <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Post-code TA4 4DP</span>, West Quantoxhead.

This trip is a walk along the beach west of the steps down to St Audrie’s Bay from Home Farm Holiday
Centre, towards the west and beyond the conspicuous cliff waterfall, and after, if time permits, back
to the east to the headland of Blue Ben. The higher part of the beach is pebbly, so watch your
footing; do not get close to the cliffs. With care, there are no great risks. Sensible shoes/ boots and
clothes. The tide is falling.
