Bristol Naturalists Society is holding a joint field meeting with the Bath Geological Society to St Audries Bay, near Watchet, with its Lias (Jurassic) exposures and fossils. Because of the tides (low tide is at 15:30) the trip will start at 12:00 through to about 17:00.

This meeting is being organised at the suggestion of Barkers Leisure, who manage the St Audries leisure site with its caf√©/restaurant and accommodation facilities.

This will be a great day out and an excellent opportunity to visit an exceptional locality.
