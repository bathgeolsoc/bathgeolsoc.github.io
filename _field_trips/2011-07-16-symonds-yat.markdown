The spectacular scenery of the River Wye in its deep forested gorge at Symonds Yat is a widely-known and regular attraction to visitors. Here, gently-tilted Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone strata are exposed in cliffs and crags, where they may be examined and their origins revealed. This gently-paced 6 mile walk, which remains above ground, will visit a host of little-known landforms. The fascinating history of underground watercourses in the Limestone will be described, ancient examples of which have become dry and revealed by surface collapses and incision of the gorge. During the Ice Age, man and animals such as lion, mammoth and bison were present, and more recently extensive tufa deposits have formed below waterfalls. The remarkable Suckstone, a 30,000 tonne monolith of Old Red Sandstone, possibly one of the largest fallen rocks in Britain, will also be seen.

There will be a complete handout detailing all the logistics and geology of this trip available at the July lecture meeting.
Meet at the big public car park on the plateau top near Yat Rock at 9.15 a.m. The car park is charged - all day ticket required. We shall descend to the passenger ferry from here; we will re-cross the Wye later by a wire bridge! The day will finish at about 6.00 p.m.
