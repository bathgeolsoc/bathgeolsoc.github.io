During the course of this Saturday dayschool, most of the fossiliferous sequence will be examined and a picture will be built up of the geological history of the area and the changing palaeo-environments. The strong relationship between rock type, geological structure and topography will be explored during the traverse. Silurian marine and terrestrial sediments exposed in the north-south trending Usk anticline will be examined and the Usk sequence will be compared and contrasted with the more familiar stratigraphy of south Shropshire, Ledbury, Woolhope, May Hill and so on.
