The day will be spent looking at the cliff and foreshore sections to the east of the beach access at Lilstock Bay. The trip will examine the Triassic-Jurassic transition sequence between the Penarth Group (Westbury and Lilstock Formations) and the Blue Lias. This will provide the opportunity to discuss the causes of end Triassic extinction / biotic crisis. We will also look at the fault and fractures exposed in both cliff and foreshore including relay ramps which provide an appreciation of how faults propagate and link-up. A classic example of a fault gouge will also be examined.

Other subjects of interest include coastal geomorphology and the fossils (ammonites!). The remains of the old port near the beach access will also be visited.

<strong>Practical and HSE:</strong> Low tide on 29th May is about mid-day so most of the walking will be on the foreshore platform which is relatively easy, although some clambering over the rocky ledges, which form mico-cuestas, will be required. Walking over rounded cobbles of the upper shore face storm beach will also be necessary, especially later in the afternoon, due to the rising tide. It should be possible to avoid thick Severn Estuary mud. There are no facilities on the beach. Please bring a packed lunch.

Parts of the cliff face are especially hazardous due to overhanging ledges of Blue Lias paper shales and limestones. Extreme care should be taken and hard hats are mandatory. Stout boots with ankle support are advised.
