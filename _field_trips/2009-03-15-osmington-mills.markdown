We will be working west and east of Osmington Mills along the beach. West of Osmington Mills the beach is shingle but east it is boulder-strewn with dipping ledges. The succession seen is Oxford Clay, Corallian, Kimmeridge Clay with unconformable Upper Greensand brought down in landslips. At low tide, folded Corallian strata can be seen including Osmington Oolite in wave-cut surfaces. There is also faulting. On the beach west of Osmington Mills the boundary between the Corallian and Kimmeridge Clay can be seen. There is abundant landslip material especially Osmington Oolite, Kimmeridge Clay and Upper Greensand. To the east of Osmington Mills the Corallian succession dips gently eastwards to Ringstead and the whole succession is exposed on the beach and in the cliffs. Sedimentological and trace fossil features are outstanding. Historically this area was important because of the discovery of oil seeps which resulted in the exploration for oil in southern England.

Meet at 11:00 a.m. Smugglers Car Park G.R. SY735816. Hard hats, boots and a packed lunch are required. Wecan provide some hard hats but please bring your own if you can.
