A wonderful opportunity to collect fossils from the Upper triassic rocks (200 million years old) at Manor Farm, Aust. Fossils are very abundant and include the teeth of sharks, reptiles and very occasionally dinosaur bones. The leader will bring part of his collection of fossils, collected at the Manor Farm site, for all to see. A geological information board has been installed at the site.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at grid reference ST 574896. We will investigate the site in the morning and it is hoped that in the afternoon some conservation will be undertaken. Please bring spades, etc. Hard hats essential. For more information please contact Simon Carpenter tel. 0117 9779616 or email simonccarpenter@yahoo.com
