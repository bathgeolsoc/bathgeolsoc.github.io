This excursion will visit the Upper Triassic (Mercia Mudstone and Rhaetic) and Lower Jurassic sediments along the coast at Penarth, where there are abundant fossils, a range of sedimentary structures and deposits of gypsum (alabaster, Penarth ‘marble’). After lunch we will travel about 5 miles west through Sully to Bendrick Rock to see the marginal Triassic sediments of the Mercia Mudstone. Here there are fluvial sandstones and conglomerates, dolomitic and evaporite lake deposits and dinosaur footprints.

Meet on Penarth Promenade at 10.30 am. Finish around 4 pm.
