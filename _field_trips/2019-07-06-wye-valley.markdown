The geology of the area is of Old Red Sandstone as far as Tintern and below this point to Chepstow it is Carboniferous limestone.

Meet at 10 am in Tintern Abbey car park, (G.R. ST 533 001), £3.00 no time limit.

We then transfer into as few cars as possible to go up to Tidenham, from where we walk down to Tintern via the Devil’s Pulpit, and have lunch in Tintern. After lunch, we visit the quarries from which the abbey was constructed.
