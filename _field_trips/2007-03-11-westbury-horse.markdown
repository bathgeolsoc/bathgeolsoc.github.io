The Chalk here forms the northern edge of Salisbury Plain. The trail will show how the underlying rocks (Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous) affect not just the landscape, but also how people have made use of the natural resources.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at the car park near the White Horse, G.R. ST 899514. The trail is 5km (3.25 miles) and takes about 2 hours. Strong shoes and waterproofs are required.
