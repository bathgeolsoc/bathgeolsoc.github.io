This is a c.5 mile circular walk in the Vale of Wardour. To register please email Bob Mustow at <a href="mailto:field@bathgeolsoc.org.uk">field@bathgeolsoc.org.uk</a>. Joining instructions and meet up location will be emailed to registered participants.

We will eat at the Wyndham Arms at about 1pm and  be leaving c.2.30pm to travel to Chilmark Quarry (about 15 minutes away) to arrive there at about 3.00pm. Isobel Geddes will be leading the group at the quarry. Be aware that following rain this can be a very 'gloopy' place as the limestone gets mashed like custard up by the vehicles, so wellies may be required. Hammers may be brought.

Please also select your meal (if required) from the <a href="/assets/Wyndham Arms menu Sept 21.docx">Wyndham Arms menu</a> and send this to Bob ideally 10 days before the trip so that the pub can be informed. Please be aware that portions at the Wyndham are large and starter size is more than adequate where available. No monies should be sent at this time as meals will be paid for on the day.

The walk has one or two steeper climbs as we go over the top of Greensand Ridge and we go over several stiles. It would make sense for everyone to have a hi-viz gilet for the quarry.

Steve will be selling the laminated Vale of Wardour guide produced by Wiltshire Geology Group which is Â£2.
