The Museum houses Oxford University's extensive world wide collection of zoology, entomology, geology and mineralogy, including the local dinosaur finds, a 40ft Tyrannosaurus rex, the observation beehive and Alice's Dodo. The building itself is one of the finest examples of the Victorian Gothic style of architecture, exhibiting a wealth of naturalist carving: the huge glass roof over the central museum court is supported by cast iron shafts, decorated with wrought iron spandrels.

This is a follow-up to Dr Price’s lecture on ‘Marbles and other Decorative Stones’ in April 2007 and her kind invitation to visit the museum.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at the Museum. Park and Ride recommended.

Packed lunches or eat at one of the local pubs.

Please note that the Pitt Rivers Museum is closed at the moment for building work.
