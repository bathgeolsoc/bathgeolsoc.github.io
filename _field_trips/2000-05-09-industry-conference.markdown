In May 2000, the North American Forum on the Geology of Industrial Minerals is being combined with the UK Extractive Indistry Geology Conference to make a special meeting to mark the Millenium. It will be the first, and perhaps only, time that the Forum will have its annual meeting outside North America.

Most of those attending will be geologists working in the quarrying, clay extraction, opencast coal and industrial minerals industries. An ambitious programme is being organised. Field trips to Bath and its surroundings and further afield will be an important part of the conference.

The Bath Geological Society has been asked to participate in this programme, in particular to organise field visits in the Bath area in the afternoon of Tuesday 9th May.
