In the morning we will visit the remains of the Greyfield (or Greyfields) colliery at the west end of High Littleton. There will then be an easy 1km woodland walk south across the Upper Coal Measures to the Stephen's Vale waterfall where we will see well-exposed, massive sandstones at the base of the Upper Coal Measures. On returning to the village, we will note the local building stones and walk the short distance east to Rugbourne Farm where William Smith lodged from 1791 to 1795. He was employed to survey the nearby Mearns coalmine, the site of which is visible from the farm; there are also good views of the landscape and geological features thereof. We will consider the coalfield geology and how Smith benefitted from even earlier (much earlier) miners' empirical knowledge of its structure. In the afternoon, we will visit Camerton mine Nature Reserve which has a scenic circular walk over the huge landscaped mine waste tip, with many good information panels.

We shall refer to the Wells and Frome geology maps.

Meet at 10.30 a.m. at the Church in High Littleton ST646580 (easy on-road parking around - not on the A39!) There is a convenient pub, The Hunter's Rest or we can picnic at the Nature Reserve at Camerton mine.
