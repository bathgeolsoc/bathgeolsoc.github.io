The Triassic rocks near Sully and Penarth (50 miles west of Bristol), near Cardiff, were deposited around the edge of a lake or inland sea in which the Mercia Mudstone/ Keuper Marl was deposited. The Trias overlies the Carboniferous limestone which locally created hills and cliffs around the lake; wave-cut shore-platforms and wave-notches were cut into the limestone cliffs, and screes of Carb Lst debris were formed, locally reworked into beach gravel breccias. A range of shoreline limestones was developed – with stromatolites, ripples, tepees, birdseyes, and these are interbedded with soils (calcretes) and evaporites, mostly gypsum-anhydrite, since replaced by dolomite and quartz. Dinosaur footprints are also present in the muddy marginal lacustrine sediments.

The day is dependent on the tides and we shall visit Swanbridge, Sully Island, Bendrick Rock and Lavernock Point.
