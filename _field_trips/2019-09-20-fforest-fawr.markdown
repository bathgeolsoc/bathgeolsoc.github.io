It is proposed to undertake a traverse of the Black Mountains - an excursion through the Carboniferous Coal measures, Old Red Sandstones and Limestones and into the Silurian sequences within the Sawdde Gorge, the glacial and landslide legacy in the Devonian Senni Formation and industrial remains associated with limestone and sandstone quarrying.

We will be led by Dilys Howell, author of the geological walks book ‘The Land of the Beacons Way’ and Dr Geraint Owen, recently retired geologist from Swansea University.

Both are very active members of the Geopark management group.  Alan Bowring, Geopark Development Officer will also meet with us. Travel will be by car and we will be staying in Brecon, in a small guest house run by a couple who are themselves enthusiastic geologists. Cost including bed and breakfast and local travel, but excluding evening meal will be £250.
