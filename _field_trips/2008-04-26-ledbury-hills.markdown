We will explore the geological history of these beautiful unspoilt hills, largely composed of sedimentary rocks of Silurian age, thrown into folds by the mid to late Carboniferous tectonic movements which formed the Hercynian or Variscan mountain belt between the supercontinents of Laurussia and Gondwana. The geology is faithfully reflected in the scenery, composed of alternating layers of resistant and non-resistant rock, many of which are rich in fossils, which in the case of the lithologically non-diverse Ludlovian have been the method for dividing the sequence into rock units. Large-scale diversion of drainage took place during the Pleistocene with the production and overflow of a pro-glacial lake.

Meet at 10.30 a.m at the large car park at British Camp (G.R. SO 764403). Fairly strenuous climb to the top of the Herefordshire Beacon if the weather is clear to gain an overall view of the area, followed by visits to various sites where rocks and structures can be examined.

Strong footwear and waterproofs are required. Bring packed lunch, or can be purchased at the car park.
